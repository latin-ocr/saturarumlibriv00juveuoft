The Style of Juvenal

36. The work of few poets presents at the same time such
high excellence and such glaring imperfection as that of
Juvenal. His extraordinary gift for thelifelike presentation
of details was rcinforced and displayetl to the best advantage
by a style whose rhetorical brilliance was due partly to his
own nature and training and partly to the tendencies ot' his
time. No one who has read the first satire, for example, can
ever forget the picture of Crispinus with his Tyrian cloak and
massive ring, os the young sport showing off his fast horses
to his sweetheart on the Flaminian Way, or of the distribu-
tion οἱ the dole in the early morning to a motley crowd.¹
But this command of details and mastery of brilliant phrase
is counterbalanced by an almost complete laok of the sense of
proportion and an utter disregard sor harmonious strueture.²
The third satire is perhaps the only one which is not open to
objection from this point of view, Xone of these poenis, then,
has held its place in the world's literature because of its liter-
ary form as a whole, but rather because of the excellent descrip-
tion and portraiture and the skilt’ul presentation of details.

37. One of the results of Juvenal's rhetorical training was
his extensive use of senlentiae. Many verses and brief pas-
sages which are of the most striking character contain state-
ments of such general application that they may be separated
from the context without losing their f01·ce.³ One might
quote, ior example, the following:

crescit amor nummi, qnantum ipsa pecunia crevit.
nemo repente fuit turpissimus.
rara in tenni facundia panno.

¹ nmff. 60ff. 9511.

² For exainples see introductor-y remarks to Satires ι, 4. 7, and 11.

¹ A considerable number of euch verses, which do not seem to be required by the
context, were once regarded by some critice as notes introduced from the margin ; now,

however, they are accepted by all as genuine.
