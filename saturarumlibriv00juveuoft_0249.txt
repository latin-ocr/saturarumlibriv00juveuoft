sarran 1v 51

98. &sterculus . . . gigantis: usually taken as equivalent to filius [errae
(a. person of low origin), because the (Jifsantes were sons of earth; cf.
Pers. 6, 59 s. But this does not explain fraterculus and the contras-t
between the diminutive and ye'yas. Juvenal wished to einphasize the
perilous position of the noble, which is even inore perilous than that of
the giant's little brother. Friedl. sees in this an allusion to some tale
in which a giant abused his little brother.¹

99. ergo: see ἓ 157 and note on 1, 3.

100. figebat: see note on 1, 23. Numidas: sec ,ξ 47, b.

101. venator: Acilius must have entered the venatio (note on 1, 22) in
the gaiues held at Doniitian's Alban villa. But even his apparent inter-
est in such pul-suits could not disarin the jealousy which his noble birth
aroused in the brcast of the tyrant.

102. patricias: see note on 1, 24. miratur: see ξ 136, τι.

103. Brute: an allusion to the simulatcd idiocy by which L. iunius
Brutus allayed the suspicions of the king, Tarquinius Superbus (Liv.
1, 56, 7 ff.). barbato: i.e. antiquo. The early Romans wore hair
and beard unshorn until about 300 B.C., when barbers were introduced
from Sicily (Varro, R. R. 11, 11, 10) ; cf. 5, 30 ; 16, 31, and Hor. O. 1,
12, 41 intonsis Curium capillis. In the time of Cicero, and probably in
that of Juvenal as well, men usually wore beards until they were about
forty years of age ; ef. 6, 105, 215.

104. melior vultu: ef. l. 75 pallor, 1. 97, and 9, 12 vultus mavis.

, 105. Rubrius: probably Rubrius Gallus, who had held important mili-
tary commands under Nero, Otho, and Vespasian.²

106. cinaedo: the natural object rather than the author of satire.
Juvenal wishes to suggest that Rubrius is himself a cinaedus.

107. Montani: not with certainty identified3 cf. ll. 136 ff. and on the
construction of Montani venter, see ξ 52.ει

108. matutino: cf. 6, 523 and see ἓ 55. Crispinus : see note on l. 1.
This comparatively mild criticism of his extravaganee is less than we
should expect in view of ll. 1 ff.: but see Introd. to this satire.

109. redolent: Miuutius Fundanus on the death of his daughter
directed that the amount which he would have spent on her trousseau ‘in
tus et unquenla et odores inpenderetur (Plin. Ep. V. 16, Τ). funera:
‘ corpses‚’ as in 10, 259 ; cf. 1, 146 ς 10, 241. This poetic use is seen also
in Vergil, Horace, Propertius, aud Valerius Flaccus.

¹ Κ. Zacher, Philologus, ιη, 1897, pp. 555 f.. identifies the giaut with a charioteer
named Porphyrio, whom Martini, xm, 78, calls qiqas.

² The latter part ol' this verse may point to au inti-igue. perhaps with the wife ot
Domitian (gloss p). ³ On the use of venter aud abdomen, see A.L.L. ιν, p. 103.
