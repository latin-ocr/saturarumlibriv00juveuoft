Other cadences are exceptional. They involve some conflict,
and they arc largely confined to the early poets and satire.

Os these exceptional cadences the most endurable is repre-
sented by

III. Nota magis nulli domus est sua Ι quam mihi lucus.

The rule of the monosyllable here—which softens the con-
flict as much as possible—is never broken by Martial, and by
Juvenal only in 3, 135 and 7, 160 (01, however, 10, 140).

IV. Dormiret, stulta est clementia Ι 011111 tot ubique

is very rare. The only cases in Juvenal are 1, 17, 30 ; 3, 54 3
13, 65.

To end the hexameter with a monosyllable was always bad.
It involved confiict, as do all other exceptional cadences, and
was not sonorous. But if the monosyllable was preceded by
another monosyllable, the cadence was endurable, though
always exceptional. The most frequent, therefore, of the
monosyllabis: cadences are :

V. Et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus et nos,

(rarest 111 1110 second satire, most frequent in the eighth) and
its sub-varieties (of which Juvenal furnishes an occasional
example) :

Argillam atque rotam citius properate, sed ex hoc

and
Quantum grammaticus meruit labor ἱ) 01 tamen ex hoc.

The habitat of v and its sub-varieties is Horace (about 5 γέ),
Juvenal (3{5 ᾗ), Persius (3 γέ), and Lucretius (15— ff).

Other lines ending with a monosyllable are represented by
the following types :

VI. Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreuS, ut teneat se,
VII. Quid tamen exspectant, Phrygio 'quos tempus erat iam,
VIII. Conduetas Corvinus oves, ego possideo plus.
