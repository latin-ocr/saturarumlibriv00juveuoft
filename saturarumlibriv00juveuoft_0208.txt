10 COMMENTARY

56. spectare lacunar: Quintil. 11, 11, 4 *in coqt'tando...tectum intu-
e7zles,· sec ξ 143, and for the infinitive. §117st

57. et: sve §125,f. vigilanti stertere naso: cf. Antln. Pal. X, 55,
5 s. οῠδ“ ἀκολάστου Ι οὔσης μοι γαμετῆς χρή με μύσαντα φέρειν.

58. curam . . . cohortis: thc young man expects to repair his shattered
foi-tunes in the public carcer open to him as a knight (eques). The regu-
lar inti-‹Jaluctism to the equestrian σιι)·8ιι31ιοηονιι))ι, which included many
very important functions (procurator, praefectus), was a period of rnili-
tury service as (l) praefectus cohortis sociorum, (2) tribunus Zeyz'onis,
and (ὃ) praefectus alae, usually in this order, though Claudius attempted
to change it (Suet. 25). See notes on 3,132; 7⁷ 88 and 10, 95.Ξ

59. omni : on the use of omnis and totus in Juvenal, see ξ 59, b.

60. dum: the clause is here virtually eausal ; 56θὲ 100.

61. Flaminiam: sc. vicwn. This important road, leading northward
out ot Rome by the porta Flaminia, was begun in 220 B.c. during the
censorship of C. Flaminius to connect Rome with Ariminum 011 the
Adriatic. The scene is laid, of course, outside the eity; see note on 3,

255. Automedon: Verg. Aen. 11, 476 f. equorum ayitator Achillis,
armiyer Automedon. Like Jehn with us, Automedon was proverbial
sor a driver.³ See ἓξ 51, 122. lora tenebat: this lack of dignity

is severely criticised in 8, 148.

62. lacernatae: ‘ with a coachlnan's cloak thrown over her shoulders' ;
see note 011 l. 27 and cf. Petron. 69 lacernatus cum flctyello mulionum fata
eslii. She, as well as the young man who sits by her side, has thrown
propriety to the winds⁴ se iactaret: ‘showed off’;cf. Liv. XXXIX,
43, 2 iactantem sese scorto.

63. ceras: i.e. tabulas ceratas. The wax tablets of antiquity con-
sisted of thin rectangular pieces of wood with raised edges, very like a
child's slatc. Two or inore of these, hinged together with rings, formed
a kind of book (codar), the outsides of which were of plain woodz the
inside pages, however, were smeared with wax, usually black in color, on
which the writing was traced with ·a sharp point (stilus). Such tablets
were used, as here, for memoranda, for wills (2, 58 ; 4, 19; 6, 601;
12, 123ς 14, 55), for brief letters, and for business purposes. Many are
extant, especially from Pompeii and from Dacia.⁶
