54 COMMENTARY

cially in Martial and Statius : dux maynus for Domitian in Stat. Silv.
111, 1. 62. Sec note on l. 46.

146. attonitos: see note on Ι. 80.

147. Chattis. . .Sycambris: warlike tribes of Germany. Against the
sor-incr Domitian conducted a campaign in 83 (Suet. 6); operations
against the lut ter during his reign are not recorded.

148. dicturus: see {3⁵ 111 and 118, d. ex diversis partibus: ‘from
different quarters‘3 epistula in the next verse is then singular sor plural
(3· 49, (ι); cf. Verg. Aen. xri, 708 genitos diversis partibus orbis. Some
interpret epistula strictly, and loosely translate dirersis partibus ‘ from
remote quarters.’ Ec is read in codex Bodz. only; P has et.

149. praecipiti pinna: the laurus attached to despatches indicated vic-
tory, but the pinna disaster (schol.); cf. Plin. N. H. XV, 133 and Stat.
Silv. v, 1, 93 nullaque famosa siglnatur lancea penna. It is possible,
however, that on account of praecipiti the expression should here be
taken metaphorically.

153. cerdonibus: ignobilibus (schol.); sutoribus (glossp); cf. 3, 2943 8,
182. Κέρδων was used at Athens as a name for slaves and people of the
lower order, workers for small wagcs (κέρδος). Martial applies the word
to a shoemaker, probably not as a proper name.¹ Domitian’s murderers
were men of no rank (Suet. 17).

154. coeperat: see ἓ, 104. Lamiarum: L. Aelius Plautius Lamia
Aelianus, consul suffectus in 80, was put to death by the emperor. As
in 6, 385, he is a type of the highest nobility.

SATIRE V
THE PARASITE

The treatment of parasites and poor clients at the tables of rich
patrons is a common subject in Roman literature. Plautus, Terence,
and Martia] furnish good illustrations, and Pliny, Ep. 11, 6, gives an
account of a dinner in most respects similar to the one here described.
In Pliny, however, we have the description of a real occurrence, with
none of the exaggeration which mars the page of Juvenal. On the Greek
side, Lucian (De Mero. Cond.)furnisl1es the best parallels3 and in Eng-
lish, Bishop Hall has a close imitation, even using the names of Trebius
and Virro (Sat. V, 2).

The satire as a whole is vigorous and leaves a distinct impression, but
J nvenal's usual faults are apparent. Instead of following the regular
