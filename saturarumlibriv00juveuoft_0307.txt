283. Pompeio ε in this case, as in that of Priam (note on l. 258), Juvenal
seems closely to follow Cic. Taso. 1, 86. If Pompeius had died os this

gifts to win the favor of the goddess.

² Suam of pm is awkward, but better than ειιιιηι of P, which Buecheler, followed by
Owen, retains and interprete as qibbnm mammatum, i.e. papillas. Recent suggestions
are suum Rutila ei Neucini, l. l. p. 303 and sinum Jessen. l. l. p. 511.
