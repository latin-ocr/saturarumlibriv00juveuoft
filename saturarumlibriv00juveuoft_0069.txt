and ssdd, a little less. The same sulzemata in J uvenal's first
satire² are dsss, 16 76 ; clsds, 12½3 ddss, S ½3 sclss, 13 z ;
sddd, 375 ; ssdd, 23} ἦ. The figures vary somewhat for the
different satires, but the general average is very near to that
of Vergil, with a slight increase in the heavier and less
desirable combinations, as befits the greater freedom of
satire.

151. The first foot.² The Roman poets preferred a dactyl
in the first foot. The highest average was reached (over 90 96)
by Ovid in his elegy. Juvenal's 60 95 is exactly that of Vergil's
Aeneid, but certain harsher combinations are less carefully
avoided. If, for example, a dactylic (or a spondaic) word at
the beginning of the verse is followed by a monosyllable, the
desired effect of a ‘ trithemimeral ⁹ caesura is lost, thus :

Telephus aut Ι summi plena iam margine libri,

or with a spondaic word,

Nullus iam 1 parasitus erit, sed quis serat istas,

Only eight cases of the liberty illustrated by these two
examples occur in the epigrams of Martial. Over three
hundred occur in Juvenal (fewer in the later satires).

A spondaic word in this foot, with elision before a following
vowel, thus,

Plena ipso, post hunc magni delator amici,

was avoided after Lucretius. It is not uncommon in Juvenal,
and increases to a marked extent in the last two satires.

152. Versus spondent-12⁸ This is the name given to those
hexameters which contain a spondee in the fifth foot instead of
the regular dactyl. The Homeric use of the versus spondiacus
is about one in eighteen to twenty lines. It was not intended
for effect and ends in a long word, frequently a quadrisyllable.
