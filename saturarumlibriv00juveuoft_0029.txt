INTRODL'C'HON XXV

satires of Juvenal are found reminiscences of word aud
phrase, often with the thought 01· point of view quite
changed, borrowed comparisons, parodies, metrical and
other peculiarities, all of which point to the satirist's
thorough familiarity with these writers and sometimes even
couscious imitation of them.¹ But there is 110110 with
whom Juvenal seems to have had so close a literary con-
nection as with Martial. When the two authors are read
together, as they should be, coincidences of thought and
expression crowd upon the attention in such numbers that it
is impossible to escape the conclusion that the one was deeply
influenced by the other. We have seen that the two poets
were on ternis of intimate 11101111511111,2 so that Juvenal must
have been perfectly familiar with the epigrams, the last of
which were published in the year 101-102, some time, in all
probability, before 110 had written any of the satires.³ We
are not to suppose, then, that the numerous striking parallels
are on the whole merely accidental and caused by a common
environment,⁴ or that the two poets “virtually worked
together '’ ⁵3 but rather we are led to conclude that Juvenal,
sometimes umonseiously, but often intentionally, allowed
the familiar thoughts and even the words of his friend to
reappear in his own pages. As a rule, however, he seems to
have avoided expressing the same thought in the same way
as Martial, though now and then 110 borrows Martial’s words,
giving them a new meaning or adapting them to a different
point of view.⁶

⁴ This 10 the view of Friedlauder, in Bursian's Jahresb.. Lxxu, 1892, p. 191. and
edition οἲ Juvenal, p. 46.

⁵ This view of H. Nettleship (Lect. and Eseays, Second Series, 1895. p. 131) would
involve us in great chronological difficulties.

mentioned. Many parallels are round also iu the commentary.
