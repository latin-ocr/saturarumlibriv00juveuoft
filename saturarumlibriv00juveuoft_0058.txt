liv INTRODUC'HON

aside from futurus and other future participles in combina-
tion with esse, instances are rare before Livy.¹ ’

119. Gerundive. The gerundive is sometimes used as a
future passive participle: ey. 14, 268 habitas coro semper
tollendus et austro ,· 14, 314 passurus yestcs aequanda peri-
cula rebus. In still later times this tendcncy was more
consistently carried out, ey. (mendum esse = aetum iri
in Ammianus, Symmachus, and other late writers.²

120. Pei-fect. A perfectfflarticiple is used with habere to
denote the continuance of a condition z 13, 193 f. quos diri
conscz'afacti mens habet attonito& similarly an adjective: 10,
2526 f. miseros trepidosque parentes semper habet. Sollicitum
habere is far more common than either of Juvenal’s expres-
sions.'

For the perfect participle with quamquam and quamvis,
see ἓξ 113, b and 114, b.

order of words

121. An appositive is pla-ced between a substantive and
its qualifying adjective in 3, 48 exeo tamquam maneus et ex-
tinctae, corpus non utile, daz-trae. A similar arrangement
may be seen in Catull. 64, 184 nullo litus, sola insula, teoto.

122. The subject is very frequently the last word in its
clause: ey. 1, 61 ; 3, 151 ; 6 A, 22, 34; 7, 73 15, 161.

123. The antecedent is sometimes found in the relative
clause at or near the end: eq. 1, 116 quaeque salutato cre-
pitat Concordia nido ; 3, 2571. qui saxa Ligustica portat
axis.

124. An adjective which modifies two substantives is
usually placed between them, sometimes before the conjunc-
tion, sometimes after: ey. 11, 39 f. aere paterno ac rehum
