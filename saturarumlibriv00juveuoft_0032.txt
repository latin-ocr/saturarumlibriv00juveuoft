xxviii INTRODL‘CTION

from Bobbio. now number 5750 in the Vatican Library.¹ It is
written in capital>- :md contains one hundred and four verses
from Juvenal and Persius. 'l‘his Ms„ in the important passage
15, 2³2², agrees with P in giving the eonsul’s name as Iunco.
231. A florilegium os St. Gall, ² number 870, contains
selections from Juvenal to the extent of two hundred and
eighty—two verses, and is in general agreement with P. By
the nid of this Ms. and of the scholion on 8, 157, Buecheler
restored the true reading mulio consul in 8, 148³
372. Inferior Mss. All other Mss. of Juvenal, too numer-
ous to be mentioned here in detail, form what may be called
the inferior or interpolated class (ω), of which none is earlier
than the ninth century, and almost all are later.⁴ These
Mes, differing more or less widely one from another, offer a
text decidedly inferior to that of P, though in agreement
with P sufficiently often to render any clear-cut distinction
from the better Ms. i1np0ssible.⁵ In the codex Laurentianus,
XXXIV, 42, of the eleventh century, at the end of the first
book, and in the codex Leidensefs, 82, of the same century, at
the end of the second book, we find the notice Leyi eqo Ni-
caeus apud M. Servium Romae et mendavif If this Servius
is the well-known grammarian and author of the commentary
on Vergil, the recension of his pupil Nicaeus must be placed
about the end of the fourth century.⁷ All the Mss. of the
inferior class go back to this Nicaean recension ; PA alone,
