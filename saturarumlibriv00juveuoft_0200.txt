2 COMMENTARY

to read his own works in public.¹ In the absence of newspapei, review,
or printed book. the importancc os the custom to men of letters is obvious.
In the time of Juvenal these recitations were so numerous and for the
most part so uninteresting that men who valued their time rebelled:
hence tho complaint of Mart.. x, 70= 10 Auditur tota saepe poeta die.
Cf. 3, 9: 7, 39 ff. auditor: sc. ero ,· for the ellipsis, see'gl38, a.
Plin. Ep. 1, 13, 6 scribere aliquid quod non recitem, ‘ne videar,
quoram recitationibus adfui, non auditor faisse sed creditor.
numquamne: the addition of -ne to negative words suggests the affirma-
tive: not only nonne, but also nemone, nullusne, ete. Compare 6, 161;
13, 174. reponam: like ‘rcquitc,’ of returning evil for evil, e.g.
Sen. Dz'al. lv, 28, 5 ιήῐιινῖαηι, and, without direct object, Cic. All. xm,
12. 3 Catulo el Lucullo alibi reponemus. Horace had expressed the
same antithesis in a slightly different way in Epist. 1, 19, 39 nobilium
scrz'ploram auditor el ultor.

2. totiens: recitatione lasting more than one day are mentioned by
Pliny, Ep. 111, 18, 4; ιν, 27, 1; vm, 21, 4. Here, however, the Theseis
(ef. Aeneis, Achilleis) is merely a type of the tedious mythological epio
such as Juvenal refers to again (l. 53) and Martial osten rails at (lv, 49 ;
vm, 3: ix, 5o; Χ, 4. cto). cordi: the name occurs in Martial and
Tacitus, but no identification is possible. rauci: from the effects of
long reading ς cf. 6, 515 rauca cohors and S, 59 rauco. . eir-00.

3. inpune: emphatic position. For a similar change of ictus(inpane—
inpane), cf. 3, 53. ergo: cf. erqo 3, 281 and erqo 9, 823 see ςἐ157.
recitaverit: indicates the future result of a past action, as e.g. Verg.
Aen. ιχ, ’784 f. tantas slraqes impune per urbem ediderit 2²² togatas:
sc. fabulas, eomedies in which soene and costume were Roman as con-
trasted with palliatae in which they were Greek. The chief writer
of toqatae was L. Afranius (about 125 B.c.)‚ whose Incendium was
performed as late as the time of Nero.³

4. elegos: strictly poems in the elegiae distich, devoted chiefly to the
passion of love in its mournful aspeets ; cf. Hor. O. Ι, 33, 2 miserabiles
decantes eleqos, addressed to Tibullus. Juvenal seems to sweep over

almost the entire field of poetry in these opening verses. diem eon-
sumpserit: Seneca, Ep. 122, 11 loto die recitasse: Martial quoted on
l. 1. ingens: refers to the size os the volumen or roll; ef. Mart.

XIV, 190 Livius inqens.

advocatis hominibus scripta sua recitavit. ² Madvig, opusc. Acad„ 11, p. 87.
