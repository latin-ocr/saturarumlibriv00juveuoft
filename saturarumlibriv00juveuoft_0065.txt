type has been utilized and specially developed to meet the
ainis of professional declamation. The hexameter is also
very much diversified by the varying moods of the author.
The mood of parody which exaggerates the conventional
usages of epic, the impatient mood which deliberately trans-
gresses conventional rules because they are conventional. the
mood of pure poetry which considers them with the utmost
care, the conversational mood which takes us back to Horace
—all these are clearly impressed upon Juvenal's verse-tech-
nique and seriously affect the meaning of any laws of usage
founded 011 statistics alone. Only a few of the more impor-
tant points can be taken up here, and the discussion of them
is chiefly for the purpose of practical illustration. No at-
tempt is made to be complete and exhaustive.

146. Conflict.¹ In the first four feet of the hexameter it
was the aim of the Roman poet to avoid the coincidence of
verse-ictus with regular word-accent. This conflict was de-
sirable in all four places, the general rule in three or two,
demanded in at least one. From this point of view a verse

like Lucretius, Ι, 77,

Quanam sit ratione atque alle terminus haerens,

was faulty. Such lines occur for the most part in the earlier
poets and are very rare.

This law of conflict is of the greatest importance. It should
be clearly understood and always kept in mind, inasmuch as
the observance of it, owing to the one invariable law of Latin
accent, is the principa] organ of development in the teehnical
history of the Roman hexameter. This is especially true of
the caesura and, above all, of the so-called secondary (mascu-
line) caesurae, the real object of which, in most cases, is to
produce that conflict which always accompanies them.
