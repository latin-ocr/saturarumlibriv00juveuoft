INTRODUCTION vii

the first saturae of which we have any knowledge, those of
Q. Ennius (239-169 B.C.), are simply a collection of poems,
in various metres, treating of various subjects. The same
literary form was adopted by M. Terentius Varro of Reate
(iic-28 13.c.), in his Saturae ilsem'ppeae, which, though mod-
elled to some extent after Menippus, yet in their general char-
acter differ little from the saturae of Ennius.

4. Lucilius and his successors. To O. Lucilius (180-
103 B.C.), on the other hand, is ascribed the introduction of
the element of personal criticism and invective, an element
which is characteristic in varying degrees of the satiric
writing of Horace, Petronius, Seneca, Persius, and Juvenal,
and is an essential feature of satire in modern literature.
At the same time, the conception of the satura as a medley
seems never to have faded out of the Roman mind; for every-
where a wide range of subjects is admitted, and in Lucilius,
Varro, and Petronius various metres are employed, though
Persius and Juvenal, following the example of Horace,
excluded all but the dactylic hexameter. The variety of
subject, the personal element, the dramatic situation and
occasionaldialoguc, the criticism of men and manners, and
the colloquial style—the leading characteristics of the de-
partment—are all prominent in Juvenal, who must now be
considered in more detail.¹

many a celebrated writer we are left almost entirely without
