again in ὁ, 321. 376: 61. Son. Ep. 120, 19 modo Licinum divitiis, Api-
cium cenis, Maecenatem deliciis provocant.

10, 226; so 10, 305 Ξ 14‚315a11d 13, 137 almost: 16, 41. See ξ 142 and
p. xiv. n. 3.

26. pars Niliacae plebis: similarly of persons in S, 44 z-olyz' pars ultima
nostri and Claud. Ε ntrop. 1, 153 pars z‘fflzolissima turbae. For J uvenal’s
liatred 01 Egyptians in general and 01 Crispinus in particular, see 4, 1
and §la Canopi: a city on one 01 1116 1110111115 01 the Nile, probably
in this instance used 101· Egypt in general. Its name was proverbial for
immorality; 61. 6, 84; 15, 46; Luc. vni, 543 mollis turba Canopi.

27. revocante: as 11 11 were about to sall off. The lacerna is here a
substitute sor the (oya, though ordinarily it was an additional outside
garment (9, 29; 16, 45) ; it was worn also by coachmen (note on 1. 62) and
by musicians (10, 212).²

28. ventilet : Apul. Met. 11, 26 et in aureos refulyentes, quos identidem
manu mea ventilabam attonitus. By waving his hand or removing the
ring from the finger he causes the air to circulate and incidentally dis-
plays the ornament. aestivum: i.e. in summer; 61. Mart. 1, 12, 5 hic
rudis aestivas praestabat porticus umbras. See §55- Friedl. under-
stands aestivum aurum as ‘summer ring'; but cf. George Eliot, Daniel
Derondcz, chap. 68 (taking off a heavy ring in warni weather): ‘I un·
derstand why the Romans had summer rings—if they had them.’ Ju-
venal simply says that in summer, when fingers sweat, Crispinus airs
1115 ring, which is as heavy as he can bcar.³ Mart. XI, 37 speaks of a
ring which weighed a pound and was more suited to the ankle than
to the finger. aurum: here and in 7, 89=a ring, in 6, 589: a
chain (P), and in 10, 27 z a bow] : see ἓ 129, c.

Vetti. teneat: Cic. Sest. 117 viz se populus Romanus tenuit.

¹ C. F. W. Mflller, in Friedl.

² Juvenal may here have reference to an official uniform, perhaps that of the praefectus
praetorio. In the meeting of the imperial council described in the fourth satire the only
one present who is not a senator, besides the praefectus praetorio, Fuscus, is Crispinus ς
cs. 4· 3⁴2 princeps equitum and Mart. vm, 48. This is the opinion of Borghesi, Oeuvres, v,
pp. 514-6. and os A. Gercke, Gott. gel. Anz. 1896, pp. 9751. ; for the contrary view of
Hirschfeld and Friedl., sec references given by Stein in Pauly-wisa, lv, 1720.

² This interpretation, advocated by Gercke (l. 1.) and Duff, is supported by the echo in
Dracontius, Laud. Dei, 111, 56 qui solet aestivum membris sudantibus ostrum poscere.
