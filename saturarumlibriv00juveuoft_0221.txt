SATIRE 111 23

SATIRE III

THE POOR IN THE GREAT CITY

It is generally admitted that this is the best os Juvenal‘s satires. The
faulty structure, the absurd cxaggeration, and the empty rhetoric which
disfigure some of his work are not obtrusive here, and his descriptive
powers are seen at their best.¹ After giving his piece a dramatic setting
by introducing Umbricius as the speaker, Juvenal paints in distinct out-
line and vivid color scene after scene from Roman life. Nowlierc in
literature, perhaps, have we inore clear and lifelike pictures of the past,
—which, once enjoyed, become a priceless and abiding possession.

Among modern imitations the most noteworthy is Samuel Johnson’s
‘ London, a Poem in Imitation ot' the Third Satire of Juvenal‚’ published ,
in 1738. The translation of Dryden is found in vol. xm, pp. 135 ff.

1-20. I am quite upset by the departure of my old friend Umbricius,
but Ι think he is wise in seeking a safer and more congenial home.
While his effects were being packed into the wagon, he walked with me
into Egeria's vale, now the haunt of beggars.
