1 8 COMMENTARY

growth of population and consequent increase of judicial business neces-
sitated the dedication of more space to the courts, which henceforth
occupied the newsorum.¹ Apollo: Pliu. N. H. vn, 183 Apollinem
eboreum. que· est in soroAuyusle'. Similarly Martial, 11, 64, 8, speaks of
the statue of Marsyas in the forum Romanum, ipse potest fieri Marsya
causidicus.

129. triumphales: sc. statuae. As a partos the ornamentation of the
forum of Augustus statues with honorary inscriptions (tituli ,· see note on
5, 34) ² were erected to famous men, especially to generals who had cele-
brated triumphs (Suet. Any. 31). Augustus was very caresul to admit
to this honor only the most worthy, but some of his successors, notably
Nero and Domitian, disregarded the earlier restrictions and granted
statues by special favor.

130. Aegyptius atque Arabarches: it is usually supposed that Juvenal
refers to Tiberius Iulius Alexander, one of the most brilliant soldiers of
his time, who, though the son of a Jew'of Alexandria, became a Roman
eques and later praefectus Aegypti in 66 A.D. If he is meant, the fact
that he was the first to proclaim Vespasian emperor and that he was in
command with Titus at the siege of Jerusalem might account for the
presence of his statue in the forum of Augustus. Arabarches (Ἄραψ-
ἄρχειν) in two Greek inscriptions is the technical title for a high official
in Egypt.²³ Here, however, as in Cicero, Att. 11, 17, 3, the word is used
ironioally. Cf. our use of ⁴ Nabob,’ ⁶ Grand MoguL’ etc.

131. non tantum: the ellipsis of sed etiam is suggested ; cf. Hor. Sat.
1, 8, 38 and see ,Ξ 138. fas est: see note on 10, 257.⁴

132. veteres: ‘of long standing‚' as in 3, 1 ; 5, 64 ; 6, 346, etc. For
contrast with antiquus, ‘of ancient date‚’ cf. 6, 21, and 15, 33; as a
substitute for antiquus, see note on 14, 189.

133. longissima: Stat. Theb. 11, 321 spes, ubi Zonqa venit, (animum
exedit).

134. caulis . . . atque ignis: see note on 1. 119.

136. rex: the name usually given by clients to their patron, e.g. 5, 14,
130, 137, 161 ; 7, 45. This reflection of the Greek use of βασιλεύς is com-
mon as early as P1autus.⁵ vacuisque toris: cf. 1. 95 and 5. 17.

¹ Lanciani, Ruins and Excavatione os Ancient Rome, pp. 302-7.

² The extant fragments of these inscriptions, some from the originals‚ but more from
the copies which were set up at Arretium, Pompeii, and elsewhere, are edited and dis-
cussed in C.I.L.12. pp. 186-97.

³ C.1.G. 4751, 5075.

⁴ On the basis of menqere, the reading of P, minqere instead of meiere (ω Priscian
Eutyches) is advocated by P. Rasi, Rivista di Fit, xxv, 1897, pp. 567-9.

⁵ See Hauler's note on Ter. Phor. 338 ; Brix on Plaut. Cape. 92.
