for the man himself, as eg. Plaut. Capi. 229 f. tu nuno vides pro tuo
caro capete carum offerre me meum caput vilitati.

177. iactura: see note on l. 8.

178. depositum: see note on l. 16.

179. invidiosa: emphatic position ; the consolation to be derived from
:1 bloody revenge is offset by the hatred which would be incurred.
solacia: sce ξ 4ἕί.ι

181. indocti: sc. dicun& see ἓ 138, b and note on 11, 5.

182. flagrantia: for a similar figure, see note on l. 14.

184. Chrysippus: the third head of the Stoic school, succeeding Zeno
and Cleanthes. mite Thaletis ingenium: see§ 52. Thales was the
earliest of the Greek philosophers. The epithet mite is quite in har-
mony with the facts and implies a contrast to the spirit of Chrysippus.
For similar implied contrasts‚ cf. Hor. C. ΙΙ, 17, 17 f.; ib. 13, 39 f.

185. Hymetto: the honey of Mount Hymettus, near Athens, was
famous in antiquity; cf. Hor. O. Η, 6, 14. The old man is Socrates,

the death of Socrates with that of Theramenes. nollet: on the

195. animo tortore: on the use of substantive as adjective, see ἓ 47, α.

197. Caedicius: not to be identified with the causidicus of 16, 46. The
name of Aeacus the torturer (1, 9 f.) was to be looked for in this connec-
tion; the plebeian nomen was doubtiess chosen because of its etymo-
logica] suggestiveness. Rhadamanthus: see note on 1, 10.

198. nocte dieque: see note on 3, 105.

199. Spartano: Glaucus, the son of Epicydes, who asked the Delphian
oracle whether he might not keep a sum of money which had been placed
