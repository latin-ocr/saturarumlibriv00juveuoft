iv PREFACE

very great obligation to my friend and oolleague, Professor
Kirby F lower Smith, not only for the chapter on Metre‚ which
is entirely his, but also for almost daily help and oounsel for
years; and to the editors of this series, especially to Professor
Gildersleeve, who has read the proof sheets and added value to
both Introduction and Commentary by many a helpful sug-

gestion.
HARRY LANGFORD WILSON.
