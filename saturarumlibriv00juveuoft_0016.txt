interval.¹ The a-vailable evidence for fixing the date of the
second book (Sat. 6) consists ot' the reference to earthquakes
and floods in the far East aud toa comet which portended
disaster to the Armenian and Parthian kiugs.² On the
basis 01 the records 01 Chinese astronomers, F1·iedlander⁸
argues with great probability that the comet referred to is
one which was visible at Rome in November of the year 115,
for the campaign of Trajan against the Parthians was under—
takcn in the next year.⁴ In December, 115, also, the city of
Δ10110011 suffered severely from earthquake. If these are
really the phenomena to which Juvenal refers, it is perfectly
clear that the second book (Sal. 6) was published in the year 116
or soon afte1·.⁵ The third book (Sat. 7—9) is introduced by the
statement that the prospects of intellectual pursuits depend
00 1110 favor of the emperor. Nothwithstanding much dis-
cussion and argument to the contrary, there is 110 reason to
doubt that the reference is to Hadrian, whose accession took
place in 11Τ.“ After this date, then, but before the year
1⁴21, when Hadrian left Rome 101· an extensive tour of the
provinces, the third book was published, probably in 119 or
120. The fifth book (Sus. 13—16) contains two distinct
chronological references⁷ by which the date of its publica-

 

¹ Friedlander (ed. of Juvenal, p. 14) assigns the publication of the first book to the
period between 112 and 116 3 F. Haverfield, on the other hand, thinks that these earlier
usatites, which ‘ reek of Domitian's reig11‚' were published soon after 100 (Class. Rev..
ΧΠ, 1898, p. 51⁸. These are the extremes ; as usual, the truth probably lies between.

⁴ The Armenian campaign, it is true, was ended iu 114, but a comet might be re-
garded as the precursor os disaster of other kinds: cf. Suet. Nero, 36 stella crinita,

⁸ O. Ribbeck (ed. of Juvenal, p. x), Teuffel-Schwabe-Warr (Hist. or Rom. Lit..
§33Q 2). and others, citing Pliny. Pan. 47, believed that Trajan was the Caesar of the
seventh satire, though the History of Roman Literatnre just mentioued contradicts
itself in the next section and says Hadrian (§331, 4). H. Nettleship (Lect. and Essays.
Second Series, pp. 132 ff. = Jonr. of Phil„ xv1, 1888, pp. 55 ff.) argued vigorously but not
convinciugly for Domitian. Cf. the introduc-tion to the seventh satire.
