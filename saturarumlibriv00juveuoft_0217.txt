SATIRE 1 19

ἓ 97. d. On extravagance in this regal-d, see note on l. 75.

138. patrimonia: ‘whole 1011111155,γ 35 111 Seneca, lt'em. Fert. 16, ’7 αα·
riculis utrimque patrimonia bina dependeant. In Juvenal the word
commonly means wealth, not necessarily inherited wealth, as 7¹ 113 ; 10,
13; 12, 50; 14, 116.

139. parasitus: see intr. to the fifth satire. istas: see §et b.

140. luxuriae sordes: this is what Pliny meant when he described his
host as sordidum simul el sumptuosum (Ep. 11, 6, 1) and said that noth-
ing ought more earnestly to be avoided than islam luxuriae et sordium
novam societatem (ib. ᾗ 7); cf. ib. lv, 2, 5 ut est in summa avaritia
sumptuosus (ἓ 131). quanta est gula: Mart. v, 70, 5 o quanta est
qula centies comesse ,· see {g 8, 26. Gula here as in ξ, 94; 11, 39; 14,
10 means gluttony, but in 5, 158 ; 15, 90 it means a glutton.

141. ponit: ‘serves up'; Pers. 1, 53 calidum scis ponere sumen ,· Mart. ⁵

v111, 22, lponz's mihi, Gallice, porcum. This use of ponere is probably
colloquial in its origin. See g 44.¹

142. poena praesens: Plin. N. H. XIV, 142 hinc (1.5. from drunkenness)
pallor et yenae pendulae . . . ‚ quae stt poena praesens, furiales somni ,· cf.
Plautus' praesens pecunia, ‘ cash down.’ The dangerous custom of tak-
ing a hot bath immediately after excessive eating was often practised in
Rome, because it was believed to aid digestion. The emperor Elagabalus
once gave a dinner os twenty-tivo courses, aster each of which the guests

after-dinner bath, 3, 98-106 lumidus laic epulis atque albo rendre Iara-

ίαν, etc. crudum: ‘undigestedss as in Celsus Ι, 2, and lv, 18 ; 111 3,

144. hinc: 011 the omission os the verb, see ἓ 138, b. intestata:

‘ not attested‚’ ‘ not witnessed,’ from negative in and testatus in its com-
mon sense of ‘attested‚' ‘ well known‚' ‘evident.’ Martial means the
same thing when he says immodicis brevis est aetas et rara senectus (VI,
29· 7) ; cf. 4, 97 prodiqz'o par est in nobilitate senectus. Others interpret
intestata according to its usual meaning ‘having made no will,‘ and re-

² Crudum, the correction ot p. is supported by Phocus, a Roman grammarian of the
fifth century, and by the scholiast on Persius (3, 98). J. D. Duff. however, following S. G.
Owen (elasa Rev„ 111, 1897, p. 400) reads with P H crudus. which 15 often used of per-
sons 111 the active sense of ⁸ not digesting.‘ i.e. · (1)·511ορ110,’ “ suffering from infflgesfion?
e.g. 6, 203 ς Hor. Sal. 1, 5, 49. This reading derives some support from Hor. Eln'sl. 1, 6,
61 crudi tumidique lavemur: but pavonem needs the qualirying adjective and the posi·
tion ot tur-fidus seems to connect it with both clause& see ς 124.
