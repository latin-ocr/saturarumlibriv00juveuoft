SATIRE 1 15

Troiades: cf. 8, 131. strictly speaking, descendants of Aeneas or his
followers.

101. nobiscum: here as elsewhere, eg. in the third satire, Juvenal
, seems to identii'y himself with the lower order of society. praetori :
the claimants receive the dole in order of rank, first the praetor, then the
tribunus plebis (l. 110). The libertinus thinks that ‘First come, first
servcd ’ would bc a justet· method.

102. libertinus: during the empire freedmen in many cases rose to
great power and riches, until finally in the reign of Commodus a freed-
man was admitted to the senate. In the first century many of the high-
est offices and positions of trust at court were iu their hands.¹

104. ad Euphraten: i.e. in the far East, whence the Romans brought
most of their slaves; Cic. Pror. Cous. 10 Iudaei-3 ei Syris, nationibus
natis servitute: fenestrae: pierced earS, with 01· without barrings,
were proof of Oriental origin ; Petron. 102 (p. 70, l. 31 Buech.) et per- “
tzinde aures, ut imitemur Arabe& Pliu. N. H. XI, 136 in Oriente quidem
et viris αἰινιιηι eo loci (i.e. in the ears) ees-tare decus existimatur.

105. arguerint: potentia] subjunctive of the present3 G.-L. 3257, 2.

106. quadringenta: sc. sestertia. This income—it can scarcely refer
to principal—-the amount os an equestrium census (note on 3, 154), seems
to Friedl. ridiculously small for one who claims to bc richer than Pallas
(l. 108). But the freedman does not say that this is all his wealth3 on
the other hand, possideo suggests the holding of real estate, as in 3, 141;
ιο, 225 ; 12, 129 ; 14, 159.2 purpura maior: the broad purple stripe
of senators, usually called latus clarus ,· I‘Ior. Sat. 1, 6, 28 lcitum demisit
pectore clarum. Statius refers to it as maior clai-123(Silv. 111, 2, 124)
and as tunica polens (ib. V, 2, 29).³

107. Laurenti: Pliny, Ep. 11, 17, 3, describing the neighborhood of his
Laurentiue villa says, multi yreyes orium, multa ibi equorum boum
armenta.

108. conductas: i.e. sheep for whose pasturage he receives hire, not

· having fiocks of his own; cf. the use of conducere in 3, 31. Corvinus:

a cognomen in the noble qen-3 Valeria, used here to typify the nobleman
in reduced circumstances Tacitus informs us that M. Valerius Messala
Corvinus, consul in 58 A.D., received from Nero a pension of 500‚000
sesterces yearly (Ami. xm, 34). ego: on the absence of connective, see
ἓ 137 and G.-L. 5483, λῖς on the rhythm, see p. lxix.
