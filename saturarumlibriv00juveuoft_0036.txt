intolerabilius nihil est quain semina dives.
si namra negat. facit indignatio 10153111.Ι

Juvenal, indeed. never appears to such good advantage as
when taken in quotations, and no other Latin author has
produced so many expressions which are still in common nse.²

FORMS AND νΟΟΑΒυΙ-ΑΒΥ ³

38. Case endings. In the genitive singular of —io-stems
both the earlier form in -i and the later form in -ii are
found: ey. 10, 123 .-1nt0ni,· 4, 31 Palati, but 8, 102 Par-
7·lzczsiz',· 3. 125 servitii. Propertius was the first poet to make
much use of the form in -iz', which was avoided entirely by
Manilius, Seneca (Trag.)‚ Persius, and Martia] (except in one
Greek word, cybiz').⁴

39. The ablative singular of the con1pa1·ati·ve ends in -i in
the following instances : 13, 48 me'norz‘; 7, 77 levioriss This
form is exceedingly rare in classical prose and not common
in poetry, but it is attested for Juvenal by Priscian (G.L.K.
11. p. 346).⁵

40. In one instance the nominative plural of a present
participle ends in -is .· 14, 300 velantia* inyuz'napanni.⁶

41. Diminutives. A fondness for diminutives is charac-
teristic of the sermo cotidianus, and is, therefore, a promi-
nent feature of satire. In Juvenal, diminutives are used in
a number of different ways, as follows :

Ι. Substcmtsees. (ι. With real diminutive force : aq. 3,
102 essqm'cnlum; 3, 22⁴3 hortulus ; 6, 57 ussello.

¹ 14, 139 ; 2, 83 ; 7, 145 ; 6, 46ος 1, 79. A large collection of such apothegms may be
found in J. Streifinger, Der Stil dee Satirikers Juvenalis, Regensburg, 1892, pp. 43-8.

⁴³ For example, take 10. 356 mens sana in corpore sano ,· 3, 165 res (mqnsla domi-‚⁴ 6,
223 hoe rulo, ,εἰσ fabem· 7, 154 crambe repetita ,⁴ ι, 79; 2, 83: 3, 152 s.; 5, 130 fn. 6.
155: 14. ιτ.

³ To facilitate reference. the most striking features of Juvenars style are set down in
a more ‹ietailed and systematic fashion. Attention is called not only to the special
peculiarities of the aatires, bnt also to divergences from 1110 classica] norm and to
characteristica of the Silver Age. ⁴ Neue. Formenlehre, 1³, pp. 134-54.
