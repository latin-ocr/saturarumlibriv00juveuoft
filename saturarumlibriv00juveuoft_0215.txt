SATIRE 1 1 7

Cic. De Or. 1, 196 Ithacam illam ίη asperrimis saxulis tanquam nidulum
affixam. Which os the temples of Concord is ineant can now scarcely
be determined, though the suggestions of this verse probably made it
quite clear to Juvenal's first audience.¹

117. summus honor: see note on 1. 110.

118. sportula: see note 011 1. 95. rationibus: ‘ineome‚ ’ the credit
side of his accounts.

119. comites: the clients (note on l. 46), who must provide clothing,
food, and fuel (famus) from the sportula, their only wage; cf. 1. 134
below and Mart. 111, 30, 1-3. toga: see note on l. 96.

120. fumus ι see ἓ 129, b. densissima . . . lectica: 13. 215 ἀωιε·ι”.ς.ςιίηα
ruya: Ovid, Trisl. v, 10, 19 densz'ssz'nms hoste's,· see ,ξ 49, b. The posses-
sion οἱ a lectica indicated wealth and high position; it was most eom-
monly used by wives of senators. Cf. 6, 351 and Dio, Lvn, 15, 4.

121. quadrantes : see notes on 11. 95 (sportula) and 109 (at end).

123. petit absenti: se. uxori sportulam.

124. clausam: by curtains, as in 3, 242. sellam: here loosely used
as a synonym sor lectica‚· the original differ-enee between the two is
shown by the etymology.

126. quiescet: on this use of the future tense, see ξ 72, b.

127-146. After receiving the sportula and acting as escort on the daily
round of business engagements, the poor clients, worn out and hungry,
are dismissed by their niggardly patron, who gorges himself in solitude
and sometimes dies from the effeets.

128. sportula: distributed apparently in connection with the salutatio
(note on 1. 95). At an earlier period, perhaps about ten years earlier,
Martial (X, 27 ; x, 7ο, 13) speaks of itas given in the afte1·noon.² For
similar accounts of the oceupations of a day, cf. Mart. lv, 8 and Χ, 70.
forum: not the foram Romanum, but the foram of Augustus, which was
eompleted in2 B.c. in fulfilment os a vow made during the war waged
against Brutus and Gassius to avenge the murder of Caesar. The rapid

who thinks that crepitat may refer to the creaking or an old wooden image of the god-
dess. The old interpretation, ⁸ The goddess hails her —- nest and clatters' (Mayor).
or ⁶ Concord, who clatters, when we huil her nest “ (Duff). rests on the assumption that
the roos of the temple was a nesting-place for storks. This explanation was suggested
by the scholiast, but has satisficd uo one ; and it seems very unlikely that so remarkable a
plu-nomenon should be. referrffll to nowhere else in the literature. On the shrines erected
in Rome to concordia. see Aust, in Pauly-Wiss.. iv, 8:31-3.

and magnifiee the discrepancy. Customs may change even in so short a period.
