tion is assigned to the year 128 or a time not much later.
As there is no evidence by which the fourth book (Sat. 10-
12) may be dated, it is naturally assigned to the period
between the third and fifth, possibly about 125.

11. Date of earliest compositions. The order of the
books, then, is doubtless chronological, but it should not be
inferred that the same is true of thc individual satires. In
the first book—leaving out of consideration the first satire,
which, as a preface‚ was probably written last of all—the
latest event to which reference is made is the murder of
Domitian (96 A.D.)¹ For this and other reasons certain
scholars have assumed that Juvenal wrote some of these
earlier satires during Domitian's reign.² Though absolute
certainty is nnattainable, it should be observed that several
circumstances point strongly to a later date. The statement
of the vitcce‚³ the silence of Martia] as late as the year 100 ⁴
with regard to any literary activity on the part of Juvenal,
and the general tone of the satires themselves, looking back,
as they do, on the past, often on the remote past, are best
explained if we assume that Juvenal not only did not pub-
lish satires, but did not write them until after the accession
of T1·ajan.⁶ If this inference is correct, the period of Ju-

the first three decades of the second century.
