¹ The interpretation of Schoemann (Neue Jahrb.. xcm. pp. 765 ff), who saw 11818 a
reference to fraudulent bankruptcy, has little support.

² An ancient relies. now inthe Muscam at Nimes. has been said to indicate that pol-
licem premere means ‘ to turn the thumb up “ ; pollicem vertere would then signify ‘to
turn the thumb down' OEriedl.. stltenqesch.. 11⁶, p. 387, x. 4). This, however, is denied
by Edu-in Post (Am. Jonr. Phil.. xm, 1802. pp. 213-25). who reproduces a photograph
of the relies in question and believes that, while pollicem vertere is ‘to turn the thumb
down(v pollicem premere is merely ⁶ to press or cover the thumb' with the fingere. For
another view. see Mayor‘s note.
