SATIRE 1 2 1

151. materiae: on hiatus in Juvenal, see ἓ 156.

153. simplicitas: 2, 18; Liv. XL, 47, 3 veneunt leqati ex: oppido, quorum
sermo antiquae simplicitatis fait, uon dissimulantium bellaturos.

154. Mucius: P. Mucius Scaevola, consul in 133 13.C., who was
attacked by Lucilius (ξ’ 4); cf. Pers. 1, 1141'. secuit Lucilius urbem, te
Lupe, te ssluci. Juvenal has in mind the freedom of speech practised
by Lucilius and hence introduces Mucius as a type ot the influential per-
sons whose vices he may expose.

155. pone: ‘ paint‚' ‘poi·t1·ay‚’ regularly used of the artist, e.g. Ovid,
A. A. 111, 401 si Venerem Cous ἰιιιδῳιαιη posuisset Apelles; one might
expect proponere in this sense, but the simple verb was the technical
word (ἓ 44). On the use of an imperative as protasis, see ,ξ 107. Sopho-
nius Tigellinus was a powerful favorite of Nero, notorious for his wan-
tonness and eruelty. He was compelled by Otho to put an end to his
own life (69 A.D.). lucebis: Plaut. Cctpt. 596 f. te.. .pi.1: atra ayi- “
tet apud carnuficem tuoque capiti Χιήἷτισεαί. This refers to the tunica
molesta, to which the modern coat of tar and feathers is most nearly an
equivalent. The Romans, however, set fire to the inflammable materials
with which the victim was covered. See note on 8, 235.

157. sulcum deducis: as your body is dragged off with the hook (uncus) 1;
see note on 10, 66, and for the change of tense, ξ 136, b. In this passage
Juvenal seems to be eonfounding two different modes of violent death,
burning at the stake (fimo pectore) and slaughter in the amphitheatre.

159. plumis: 10, 362 and Mart. XII, 17, 8 dormit et in pluma purpureo-
que toro ,· the softness of the lectica (note on 1, 120) is emphasized by the
use of this word. On the rhythm, see p. lxix.

160. cum veniet: see ξ 109. labellum: on the form, see ξ 41, Ι, d.
161. qui: the antecedent is ei understood; an exact parallel is Cic.
Dom. 20, 51 poena est (sc. ei) qui *receptu-it.² hic est: Pers. 1, 28 pul-

chrum est ‹liyz'to monstrari et dicier “laic est‚’' which Juvenal probably
remembered. This use of liic· est, which is found also in Martial‚ V,

has the future indicative with forsitan (forsan) in 12, 125 and 14, 295, but not in the
second person. See Beer. spicil. luc.. p. 60, and ξ 71, Ι).

¹ This interpretation, which goes back to the scholiast, has been considered open to
objection on account of the sudden change of tense. S. G. Owen, Classi Rev., XI, 1897,
pp. 400-1‚ adopting Maguire's suggestion (Hermann, xv, 1s83‚ pp. 422 f.) that sulcum refers
to light as in Verg. Aen. 11. 697 and other places. retains deducit with P and several
Mss. of the ω class. and supplies quae, i.e. taeda, as the subject. comparing ¹4· 105: 15, 170
and Munro, Lucr. vx, 52. J. D. Duff, however, sees in this passage another form of the
proverb for fruitless toil found in 7, 48 f.‚ for which sce note there.

² This seems more to the point as well as in closer harmony with Latin idiom than to
take the subJect of erit as the antecedent os qui. See Naegelsbach, Lat. seim, p. 361.
