216. inpensas: inpensa (sc. pecnnia) usually refers to expense as in 5,
156 ; 7, 138 ; 12, 97 3 but in this connection it doubtless means building
materials. Cf. Frontin. Aqu. 124 suturae impensae praeparatio (for re-

nominative singular. The substitution of llic, adopted by Jahn in 1851, advocated by
Owen (Class ch'.. xi, 1897, pp. 401-3), and at last receiving Ms. support in Bodl. (S 33),
seems unnecessary. The fact, too, that women in particular were devoted to oriental
cults at Rome should not bc overlooked.
