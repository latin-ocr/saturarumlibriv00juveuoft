118 COMMENTARY

pytismate: the disgusting practice of taking wine into the mouth to taste
and then ejecting it on the floor; cf. Ter. Heaut. 457 f. pytissando modo
mihi quid ϊίηί absumpsit ‚· Hor. C. 11, 14, 26 f.

176. ibi: i.e. in eo ‚· see note on 8, 64. fortunae: ‘ rank,' asin 8,
74. alea: see note on Ι, 88.

177. mediocribus: in contrast with illi, the rich and noble 3 see note
on 5, 108. haec eadem: see ἓ 61, α.

179. convivia: see 548. ludos: some form of entertainment. such
as musio, dancing, recitation‚ or even dramatic performance was a com-
mon accompaniment of a Roman dinner ; cf. 5, 1573 Varro, Menipp.
340 (Buecheler) in convivio leyz' neo omnia debent et ea potissimum quae
simul sint βιωφελῆ et delectent. See note on l. 162.

181. altisoni: with reference to the elevated style of the epic; no other
instance of this transferred use is cited. dubiam. . .palmam2 the
bine-stocking in 6, 436 f. discusses the comparative merits of Homer
and Vergil : cf. Quintil. Χ, 1, 85 (Veryilius) omnium eius yeneris poe-
tarum. . ‚haud dubie (Homero) promimus.

182. qua voce: Encolpius at the table of Trimalchio thought otherwise3
cf. Petron. 68 servus. . proclamavit subito canora voce .· ⁴ interea medium
Aeneas iam classe tenebat.’ nullus sonus unquam acidior percussit aures

184. licebat : ‘ was permissible’ ; see §72 a, (1) and note on 4, 85.

185. non : see ,Ε 77 and on ellipsis of sit, g 138, a.

188. multicia: cf. 2, 66 and 76. Such references to the wife of a
friend seem scarcely polite, to say the least ; but Persicus may not be a
real person or may have been unmarried (Weidner) or Juvenal may in
this way be giving a side-thrust at women of high degree. See ἓ 22.¹

191. pone: i.e. depone ,· see ἐ 44. inis: see G.-L. ἓ 354, N. 1.

192. perit: see note on 1, 18 periturae.

193. Megalesiacae. . . mappae: see note on 3, 138. The festival of the
Μεγάλη Μήτηρ, hence called Meyalesia (6, 69) or ludi Illeqalenses, lasted
from April 4 to 10, and concluded with races. Mappa stands for oir-
censes (note on 3, 223), since the signal for starting was the dropping of
a mappa. See also note on 14, 262. spectacula: ‘spectators'3 see
note on 8, 205.

¹ J. Jessen, Philologus, mx. 1900, pp. 519 f. calls attention to the mutuationes cena-
rum which were usual among the nobility on the occasion of the Meqalesia: cf. Fasc.
Pmen. for April 4 (C.I.L. 1 ². p. 235) ; ovid, Fast. w, 353 ff. If Juvenal has in mind
the high-born lady who spent the days of the festival in this kind of revelry, his words
could give no offence to one of lower rank.
