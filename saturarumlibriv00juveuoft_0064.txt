with the Ennian definition of satura as a literary depart-
ment, Lucilius finally settled upon the hexameter as the
form best suited to his purpose. His choice was confirmed
by Horace, and henceforth became a law of composi-
tion for Persius, Juvenal, and other satirists of the Lucilian
school.

The great primary laws of construction for the Roman
hexameter, whether epic, elegiae, or satiric, are the same,
and a knowledge of them on the part of the student is as-
sumed. So, too, from its beginning with Ennius to its cul-
mination in the first century, the Latin hexameter travelled
steadily towards the utmost strictness of technique.

But in the matter of particulars the satiric type, like the
epic and elegiae, is a separate creation. True to the char-
acter and purpose of the department, the hexameter of satire
is marked by a greater freedom of construction and more
latitudo in the various details of exceptional usage. This is
true of Juvenal as it is of Horace, though the lapse of three
generations has made Juvenal far more strict in some matters
of technique than his predecessor.

145. The hexameter of Juvenal. The difference‚how-
ever, between Horace and Juvenal is not a matter of chronol-
ogy alone. The temperament of Horace, as well as the more
direct influence of Lucilius upon his conception of satire,
suggested and perfected an easy, conversational verse, mov-
ing within the widest possible limits of artistic freedom. But
the genius and temperament of Juvenal, as well as the pur-
pose of his satire, were something quite different. He had
been a professional rhetorician and his satire is declamatory,
not conversational. Speaking in general, then, the verse of
