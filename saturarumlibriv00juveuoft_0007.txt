PR EFACE

IN preparing this edition I have had two distinct aims,
to furnish the student who takes up Juvenal for the first
time with everything necessary to the understanding os the
author and his place in literature, and to offer to teachers
and advanced students guidance and suggestion for a more
detailed study of the Satires. Both Introduction and Com-
mentary are accompanied by a series of footnotes, in which
are contained alternative interpretations aud critical discus-
sions, as well as occasional references to standard sources and
to recent literature bearing on Juvenal.

In the constitution of the text I have made use of all avail-
able critical materials, and in the case of the most difficult
passages have usually stated in the notes the reasons for my
preference. Apart from matters of punctuation the most im-
portant places in which I have ventured to differ from the last
edition of Buecheler (1893) are 2, 1063 3, 3223 6, 167, 270,
415; 7,12, 16, 24; 10, 2953 11, 1483 14, 113, 122, 216, 2173
15, 7. In these passages, with the exception of 6, 270, 415;
7, 16, 243 10, 2953 11, 1483 14, 216, 217,Ι find mysclt' in
accord with Mr. S. G. Owen, whose Persius and Juvenal ap-
peared several months after the text of the present edition was
electrotyped.

Ι shall not attempt to make any detailed statement of my
indebtedness to various sources of informati0n3 anyone who
reads with care the Introduction and Commentary will rarely
be uninformed on this point. Among the commentators the
most hel pful have been Mayor, Friedlander, and Duff, though
most of the others from the time of Domizio Calderino to the
present have been consulted. Ι gladly acknowledge also my
