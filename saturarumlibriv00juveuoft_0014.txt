Χ INTRODUCTION

“In honor of Ceres D. Iunius Iuvenalis, tribune of the
first cohort of Dalmatiam, duumvir quinquennalis, priest of
1110 doified Vespasian, vowed and dedicated (this offering)
at his own exponsc.” In favor of this identification it may
be observed that the satirist closely 8880818188 himself with
Aquinum¹ and mentions Ceres in the same connection. 11·
we may assume, moreover, that Juvenal, like most men of his
time, saw service in the army in his youth, the many refer-
ences to military life in the satires thus find a ready expla-
nation. But in the absence of the praenomen it must be
acknowledged that we are on uncertain ground3 for the
municipal official of the inscription might as well be the
father, brother, or some other relative of 1118 poet.

8. Martial. A third source of information is Martial,
the only writer of the first three centuries who mentions the
name of Juvenal.² Τ1181 1118 two poets were on 1811118 of
friendship, and even of intimacy, seems a safe inference from
1118 three epigrams that come in question.³ In 1118 seventh
book, published in the year 92, Juvenal is called facun-
dus,⁴whiol1 without doubt refers only 10 1118 ability as an
orator3 for all signs point 10 1118 having published none of the
satires until a much later date.⁵ About the year 100, after
Martial had finally retired from Rome to his native place in
Spain, he writes to Juvenal 88 follows t

2 The only other references to Juvenal in Latin literature—aside from quotations
or reminiscences of the 8811188 during the fourth and following centuries (ef. §2T)—ate
made by Sidonius Apollinaris, lx. 269 ff, who mentions Ovid's banishment in the
881118 sentence with that of Juvenal (cf. 515), by Ammianus, xxvur, 4, 14, who informs
us that Juvenal was diligently studied in the fourth century, and by Rutilius Namatianus,
1, 604. who merely mentions the name of the satir-ist.
