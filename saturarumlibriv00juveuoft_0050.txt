xlvi INTRODcenoN

lar in Classical usage, occurs in 7, 61, 228 3 13, 97. This use
of the genitive appears as early as Plautus, is found once or
twice in Cicero’s Letters, and occasionally in Caesar, Sallust,
and later writers.¹

For the genitive of value, see ξ 94.

91. Ablative. With the ablat-ive of place the preposition
in is very often omitted : e.9. 1, 113 f. templo nondum habi-
tat ,· 4, 112 marmorea meditatus proelia villa. Examples may
be cited from Cicero and Caesar, but they are not numerous
in prose before Livy.²

92. Duration is frequently expressed by the ablative z eff.
6, 183 septenis oderit horis ‚· 7, 235 quot Acestes„ vicerit
annis ,· 9, 16 tempore Zonqo; 10, 239 multis. . .annis. The
construction is rare in Classical prose (Caes. B. O. 1, 46, 1)
but becomes common in Silver Latin.³

93. The ablative of the person, regarded as cause or instru-
ment rather than as agent, is often used without ab .· (3.9. 1,
13 adsiduo ruptae lectore columnae ; 1, 54 mare percussum
puero ; 3, 306 armato custode tenentur. An example of the
reverse sort, in which the thing is regarded as personal, is
10, 270 ab ingrato iam fastiditus ανοιίνο.4

94. With constare Juvenal expresses indefinite value by the
ablative as well as by the genitive ; 7, 77 constat leviori belua
sumptu ,⁰ 14, 258 quanto capitis discrimine constent ; but 6,
365 quanti sibe? yandz'a constent; 6, 626 ; 7, 45, 188. Cf. also
the ablatives in 3, 166, 235 ; 6, 73 ; 8, 653 14, 218.

95. Plenus is always followed by the ablative in Juvenal :
ey. 1, 32 f. lectica Mathonis plena ipso ; 3, 187 plena domus
libis ; 4, 4715. 3 5, 66; 8, '723 10, 191, 242. The genitive is
the regular construction in Cicero and Caesar, but the abla-
tive (instrumental)‚ which occurs rarely in the classical period,
