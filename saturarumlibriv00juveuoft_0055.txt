111. Tamquam is found with the future participle in a
conditional clause of comparison: 4, 147 f. tamquam cle Chattis
. . aiclurus. In thc best prose ut is so employc(l.²

112. Tamquam is used with thc subjunctive after suspicere
to introduce a substantive clause which is thc cquivalcnt of
an infinitive : 3, :222 suspectus, tamquam ipse suas incenderit
aedes ,· cf. Tac. Hist. 111, 35 suspecta Germania. tamquam
in auxilium Vitellia· accingeretur. This construction, which
is found after certain verbs (especially those of accusing),
nouus, adverbs, and adverbia] expressions, occurs very fre-
quently in Tacitus and is characteristic of the Silvcr Age.³

113. concessive. Quamquam is used as follows :

a. Usually with the subjunctive: (3.9. 7, 15 quamquam et
Cappadoces faciant ; 2, 4 etc. (nine examples). This is very
rare in classical prose, but is common in Silver Latia*

b. With the perfect participle and with an adverbia] phrase :
4, 60 quamquam diruta ; 4, 79 f. quamquam temporibus diris.
Quamquam with the participle, etc., though common in the
period of Juvenal, is very rare in the best period ; the first
instance is Cic. Fin. v, 68, which seems to be unparalleled
in Cicero's time.‘'

114. Quamvis is used in the following ways ε

a. With the subjunctive: aq. 13, 3 f. quamvis.. vicerit.
This is in harmony with the usage of the best prose.

b. With participles and adjectives: eq 3, 1 quamvis dt-
yressu veteris confusus amici ; 5, 5 quamvis iurato (nine
cases in all). It occurs with adjectives in early Latin (6.9.
Plaut. Rud. 373), but with participles probably not before
Martial and Tacitus.⁶
