SATIRE XIII
coNsoLATION ro om: wno HAS BEEN DEFRAUDED

The satirist writes to his friend Calvinus to console him for the loss of
a suin of money, of which he has been defrauded. ‘⁶ You should not
take to heart the loss of a small sum in times like these, when fraud is
common and honesty is rare (ll. 1-70). Men receive one’s money, and
then swear by all the gods they never had it, not deterred by a penalty
which comes slowly or may never come at all (ll. 71-119). And you have
no real reason to complain, for many greater crimes are committed
