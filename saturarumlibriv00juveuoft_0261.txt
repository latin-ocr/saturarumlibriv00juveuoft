vocat, hos vocat sorores, lios uatis arnul acrius duobus. rex: see
note on 1, 136.

The following digression on lcgacy-hunting (note on 3, 129) is quite in
the style of Juvenal, who takes little palus to avoid such dislocations ;
see §g 36 and 141.

189. luserit: on this rare use, see G.-L. ἓ 263, 3, N.; Lane, g 1549.
Aeneas: a parody of Dido's words in Verg. Aen.. IV, 328 f. sl quis milti
parvolus aula luderet Aeneas ‚· see g 26.

141. Mycale: concubina (gloss p). As the offspring of a concubine
could not legally inherit, Trebius, still represented as rich, might have a
number of such children, who would only be welcomed by Virro and.
presented with little gisss.¹

142. ipse: see note on l. 30. loquaci . . . nido: probably a reminis-

cence of Verg. Aen. XII. 475 pabula parva leyeus nidisque loquacibus ’

escas ‚· see g 26.

143. viridem thoraca: prasinum vestem vel italicam (gloss p). As
Juvenal uses viridis of the factio prasina in the Circus (note on 11, 198),

before, but Virro has the choicest viands that earth can produce.

146. vilibus: see note on 1. 108. ponentur : see not-e on ι, 141.
147. boletus : Mart. 1, 20, 4 boleium qualem Claudius edit, eclas
(g 26). In a boletus Agrippina is said to have given Claudius the poison
which carried him off (6, 620 f.; Suet. Claud. 44). sed: see ξ 76.
149. Virronibus: i.e. the nobler guests ; cf. 10, 108 ; 12, 39 ; see ἓ 50.
151. Phaeacum: the fruit which grew iu the gardens of Alcinous, the
Homeric king of Phaeacia (Odys-s. vn, 114 ff), and iu those of the Hes-

¹ By the assumption that Mycale—apparently a slave's name-is a concubine, Virr0·s
attitude to the children is explained (so Fricdl. and Buecheler). According to Mayor,
however, who ie followed by some inore recent editors. Mycale is the wife of Trebius.

is a poor client. The reading of P is myqale (μῡγαλῆὶ. which. notwithstanding tho
