22 COMMENTARY

13, 3, calls to mind the story of Demosthenes' elation at being pointed
out with similar words; cf. Cio. Tusc. v, 103; Plin. Ep. lx, 23, 5.

162. Rutulum : cf. 7, 68. In the latter half of the Aeneid, Turnus, the
leader of 1110 Rutuli, is the rival and bitter foe of Aeneas. Hence Juvenal
means that epil· poetry gives no offenee.

163. gravis: Pliny's reason for refusing to write contemporary history
was gravis offensae, Ievis ,qratia (Ep. v, 8, 12).

164. Hylas ε the favorite of Herakles, who during the expedition of the
Argonauts went 011 shore to draw water and was carried off by nymphs.

165. ense velut stricto: Juvenal doubtless thought of Horace (Sat. 11,
1, 39 ff.)‚who professes himself a follower of Lucilius and then contrasts
his own attitude. His pen (stilus) is a sheathed sword, which shall be
drawn only in sels-defence. On Lucilius as a satirist, see ἓ 4.

166. frigida mens: Lucr. 111, 299 (renlosa) cervorum friyida mens est.

167. sudant: a physical effect of fear is here and in 13, 220 transferred
to the mental sphere.

168. inde . . .laorimae: Ter. Andr. 126 hino illae lacrumae ,· see ἓ 138.

169. ante tubas: z ante sz'ynum datum .· cf. Verg. Aen. ΧΙ, 424 ante
tubam tremor occupat artus. This expression, drawn from military life,
seems to have become a proverb (ξ 143).ι galeatum: during the
march the soldier carried his helmet and put it on only when the battle
was imminent. Caesar (BG. 11, 21, 5) states that once temporis tanta
fui! exiquz'tas ut ad yaleas induenda& . ,tempus defuerit. duelli: an
archaie form of belli preserved as a trisyllable in the hexameter (Enn.,
Luc-r„ Hor., Ovid), but in Plautus always a dissyllable. A similar form
is clzconoro ( z bonoram) in the oldest of the Scipio epitaphs (C.I.L. vl,
1287) ; cf. dno with bis ( z duis). On archaisms 111 Juvenal, see ἓ 42.

171. Flaminia: see note on l. 61. Roads leading from Rome were lined
with tombs, for Roman law from the earliest period sorbade burial within
the city, cf. 8,146. Latina: this road led from Rome by the porta
Capena, diverged to the left from the via Appia, passed through the
hilly district of Tusculum (hence 5, 55 clivosae. . .Latinae), and touched
Ferentinum, Frusino, and Juvenal’s native town Aquinum, finally rejoin-
ing the Appia at Casilinum in Campania.

² On this use of ante and the similar use of post in short phrases which leave part or
the meaning to be inserted, see Langen on Val. Fl. 1, 139 and Vollmer on Stat. Sil. 1, 3,
16. An earlier example is Liv. XXI, 28, 6, id ut tutius consilium ante remsoret‚ etc.
