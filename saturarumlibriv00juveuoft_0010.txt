2. Roman claim to originality. Every other class of
Latin poeti-y is known by a Greek title ; satire alone has a
name distinetly Roman, and is based on no oorresponding
Greek type. For this reason the claim to originality² set
up by Horace and Quintilian must, with some modification,
be regarded as valid. When we say that satire is a genuine
creation of the Roman genius, we do not mean that there

Greek literature abounds in such elements. Nor do we
mean to say that satire, unlike all other Latin poetry, was
not largely influenced by Greek thought and Greek methods
of expressi0n3 on the contrary, such influenee was wide-

3. Early satura. Ennius. Varro. The earliest form
in which the satura existed at Rome cannot with certainty
be determined. According to Livy⁴ the term was used to
indicate a dramatic pei-formance of: varied character, in
which the old Italian verses of banter and ridicule, the 30-
called versus Fescennini, were combined with the dancing,
music, and stage action learned from Etruscan actors

metaphor of 0330111]ν the same sort. Compare our use of the word ⁴ miscellany.'

⁵ The correctness of Livy's account has in recent years been called in question by F.
Leo, Varro und die Saeve, in Hermes, xxw, 1889, pp. 67-84, and by G. L. Hendn'ckson,
The Dramatic Satura and tlte Old Conway αε Rome, in Am. Jour. Phil„ xv, 1894, pp.
1-30; cf. ib. x1x, 1898, pp. 285-311. The former sees in Livy the unwflrranted assumption
of an early Roman parallel to the Greek satyr drama ; the latter regards the passage as a
pure invention based on the history of the old Attio comedy. Neither seems to have
