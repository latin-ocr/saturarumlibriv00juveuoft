the unworthy to important military posts,¹ his familiar refer-
ences to centurions and other office1·s,² as well as his evident
intimacy with the details of camp life? all point in that
direction. He (lisplays‚ too, a knowledge of various' out-

different parts of the world in a military capacity.⁶ It seems
likely, then, that Juvenal had served in the army, though, if
we leave the inscription out of consideration, there is nothing
to suggest his rank or the duration of his service.

century that Apollinaris Sidonius ⁹ could refer to Juvenal as
irati histrionis escul and expect to be understood.¹⁰ But while
they agree as to the fact and the cause, the ancient biogra-
