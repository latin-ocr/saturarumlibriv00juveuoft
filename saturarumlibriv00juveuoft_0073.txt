The rarity of v1, v11, and v111 may be seen from the
:fact that only about 900 of them occur in the 207,209 Latin
hexameters examined by Manitius.¹ Of these 900, Lucre-
tius has 165 (2 ξό of his verses) ; Horace, 160 (4 93) 3 Juvenal,
139 (3 52) ; Vergil, 48 (1³6 ff). This was a freedom of satire
which goes back to Ennius. Indeed, many of Vergil's ex-
amples are undoubted imitations of Ennius, or else intended
to give a touch of the antique. This is especially true of v111.
which through such a famous line as Vergil, Aen. VI, 840 :

Unus qui nobis cunctando restituis rem,

must have suggested Ennius and the old poets to many of
Juvenal's hearers. In some cases at least the antique and
solemn touch, used seriously or satirically according to thc
author’s mood at the time, seems to have been felt. Com-
pare 1, 108, 1593 2, 28, 132 3 3, 90, 191, 2033 5, 20, 88, 114;
6, 32, 309; 7, 2083 8, 9, 62, 112-; 10, 82, 119, 225, etc. In
others, and possibly in some which I have just mentioned,
the touch was not so much the antique and solemn (serious
or otherwise) as the plain, old-fashioned, and homely.
The tetrasyllabic cadence,

IX. Cum populum gregibus comitum premit hic spoliator,

was, as we saw, a rule of the Catullian versus spondiacus.
Otherwise it is extremely rare, and chiefly confined to
satire and the early poets. Manitius gives Lucretius 153
cases3 Vergil 513 Horace 343 Juvenal 55. The word is
usually a proper name, except in Lucretius, who has none.
Juvenal imitates the freedom of Lucretius in this respect.
Also he frequently neglects the rule of a preceding mono-
syllable.

To end the linc in a word of five syllables is still more
uncommon :

X. Quandoquidem inter nos sanctissima divitiarum.
