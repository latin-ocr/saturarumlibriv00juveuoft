suas acl mensuram inguinis heres. This may be seen in Cicero
and Vergil. but is more common in Silver Latin.¹

daily life luade itself felt in the literature 3 (3.9. in Vitruvius,

The Adverb

65. As adjective. An adverb is occasionally used to
modify a noun: eff. 3,.204 f. parvulus iufra cantharus ; 7,
41 leaeo Zonye ferrata domus. This is less natural than in
Greek on account of the absence of au article. Examples are
rare in the literature of the Republic, but numerous in Livy,
Tacitus, and the post—Augustali poets.³

66. Utcumque and quandoque, which during the earlier
period were relative adverbs introducing clauses, are used
as indefinite adverbs : 10, 271 exitus ille utcumque hominis ;
2, 82 foedius hoc aliquid quandoque audebis amictu ; 5, 171 f.

pulsandum.. .praebebis quandoque caput ; 14, 51.⁴

67. Olim is used in various ways in Juvenal: a. Ξ iuter-
dum .· 10, 142 f. patriam tamen obruit olim ylorz‘u paucorum.
This is oftenest found in early Latin and in poetry, (3.9.
Verg. Aen. V, 125.

b. z iamdudum: (3.9. 3, 1633 4, 963 6, 42, 90, 281, 3463
9, 17. This is characteristic of the Silver Age.‘’

c. z quondam: ey. 5, 1103 6, 1573 8, 98; 10, 78, 163,
