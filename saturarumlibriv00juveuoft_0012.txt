viii INTRODUCTION

reli-able biographical detail. This is true of Juvenal, not,
however. from any lack of evidence bearing on the subject,
but because of the very uncertain character of most of the
sources on which we must ultimately depend. These sources
may be considered in the following order: Ancient biog-
raphies. an inscription from Aquinum, references in Mar-
tial, and the satires themselves. .

6. Ancient biographies. The vitae found in the MSS.
of Juvenal are as numerous as they are untrustworthy.¹
They give no dates for the poet’s birth and death3 they
appear to be based to a considerable extent on doubtful in-
terpretations ot' passages in the satires, and they are not free
from manifest absurdities. In spite of many variations and
discrepancies‚ all these biographies go back to one ancient
source ² ; nearest to that source is the following vita, which
in style and subject-matter is superior to the rest, and seems
itself to be the authority for most of the statements found
in the others.’
