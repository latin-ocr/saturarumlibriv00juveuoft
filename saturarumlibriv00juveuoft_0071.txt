153. Agl-effluent. It is an universal rule of artistic
poetry tha-t whatever liberties we may take with a verse, the
end of it should be well marked and clearly rcflect the type.
Confiict has a certain tendency to obscure the rhythm ; more-
over, the hexameter should be brought to a restful close.
The law of conflict, therefore, ceases with the fourth foot,
and for the last two feet agreement of verse-ictus and word-
accent is sought. From this point of view the favorite types
are :

A dissyllable preceded by a trisyllable at least, or, at most,
a word which shall not go back of the fourth arsis :

Ι. Aeacus, uude alius furtivae Ι devehat aurum
Cur tamen hoe potius libeat de‘eurrere campo
Hos animos? neque enim loculis comitantibus itur.

A trisyllable preceded by a (lissyllable at least, or, at
most, a word which shall not go back of the fourth arsis :

ΙΙ. Quidquid agunt homiues, votum timor Ι ira voluptas
Navigio montem aseendit. solitisque poposcit
Crispinus Tyrias umero revolcante lacernas.

A frequent sub-variety of 11 is illustrated by

Consilium dedimus Sullae prijvatus ut altum,

i.e. replacement of the trisyllable by a dissyllable preceded
by a proclitic monosyllable.
Over 9055 of all Latin hexameters end iu these two forms.
