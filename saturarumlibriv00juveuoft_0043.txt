weakening of its original force may be detected in Vergil, and
in prose from Valerius Maximus. In Juvenal the older
meaning cannot be clearly discerned in half of the occur-
rences‚ and in several instances it is certainly absent: ey.
4, 66 f. yenialis ayatur iste dies ; 6, 295 f. Izincfluxit ad istos
et Sybaris collis (the hills of Rome, in 9, 131 Itis collibus) ; Ι
cf. 1, 139 ; 3, 1873 3, 29 istic (in Rome), and Ital. stanotte,
‘to-night ³ (= ista ¹nocz‘e).¹

62. Interrogatiw. α. Quis forquz'. Juvenal always uses
quis for qui in questions both direct and indirect: ey. 6,
571 quis mensis; 7, 63 quis locus ; 14, 178 quis metus ,· 15,
119 quis casus. This is true also of Horace and Persius.²

b. Qui for quis. In one instance, doubtless for the sake
of euphony, qui is used for quis: 11, 33 te consule qui sis ,·
cf. Plaut. Oapt. 560 neque scit qui siet ; id. Uist. 16Λί nescit
qui siet.

c. Quis for uter. In two instances quis is loosely used
where only two alternatives are suggested : 8, 196 quid satius ?
10, 338 quid placeat dic. This is not common, but it occurs
in Cicero (6.9. Att. XVI, 14, 1), in Vergil (6.9. Aen». XII, 727),
and in other authors. Cf. ξ 64 a.³

d. Two interrogative pronouns are occasionally found in
one question: ey. 5, 80 f. aspice.. ‚quibus undique saepta
asparagis qua despiciat convivia cauda; 10, 69 f. quisnam
delator quibus indicibus? 1 2, 48 qua mundi parte quis audet.⁴

63. Relative. Quicumque is often used as an indefinite
pronoun (z quilibet), especially in prepositional phrases:
ay. 6, 412 quocumque ίη trivio. . marran ,· 3, 156, 230 ; 6 A,
1; 8, 2ἳ’; 14, 42, etc. This is very rare iu Cicero, but be-
comes common in the Silver Age: cf. ξ 66st

64. Indefinite. α. Quisque for uterque. As qui-s for uter
