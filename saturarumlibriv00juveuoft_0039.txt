010T10N AND SYNTAX

The substantive

47. As adjective. Aside from verbal nouns in -tor and
-trioe, the employment of substantives as adjectives is poetic
and colloquial. In Juvenal we find :

a. Verbals in -tor and ·tri:c: ey. 1, 50 victrix provincia ,·
4, 62 miratrix tnrbcffi 13, 195 animo tortore. Such nouns
are not rarely used in classical prose to denote permanent
characteristics : in the first century, however, this restrictior
is gradually removed, and momentary actions and conditions
are thus indicated.¹

b. Other substantives, including proper names ε ey. 3
110 filia virqo; 7, 107 comites libelli ,· 8, 149 f. testes oeulos,-
8, 261 f. tyrannis ememus,- 4, 100 ursos Numidas ; 11, 94
Oceano fluctu.²

48. Plural for singular. In the poetry of the Silver
Age the plural is very commonly used for the singular, espe-
cially for metrical convenience : eq. 1, 23 meda teneat vena-
bula mamma ; 4, 68 tua servatum consume in saecula rhom-
bum ,· 5, 2 3 6, 24 ; 13, 28. In 6, 383 operas ( = operam) dare is
probably colloquial, being found in Plautus, Terence, Petro-
nius, Seneca, etc.³

49. Singular for plural. A singular is used sor a
plural ε
