28 COMMENTARY

58—98. “ Rome has become so completely Greek that Ι can endure it
no longer. The Greek is cunning, bold, fluent, and versatile, and takes
precedence of us in ererything : his flattery, too, no matter how absurd,
passes for liis real opini0n.”

As the connection between Rome and the Easteru provinces grew
closer, the number of provincials who found their way to the capital was
ever on the increase. So large was the influx of Greek-speaking foreign-
ers and so great the influence they exerted that Greek came to be
spoken in Rome as commonly as Latin, and in the second century be-
came the language of the court.

58. acceptissima: see ἐξ 57, c and 138, a.

61. Graecam urbem ε ‘ the city become Greek.’ The Greek point of view
is naturally quite different3 cf. Lucian, De mercede conductis.¹ quam-
vis: on this rare use, see ἓ 114, c. quota: to quot as sexta to sem cf.
quota pars in 13, 157. faecis: Luc. vn, 405 Romam. . mundi faece re-
pletam. Achaei: subject of sunt understood (g 138, a). The natives of
the Roman province of Achaea were naturally not the only Greek-speaking
people in Rome, for Greek was the predominant language in the East.

62. Orontes: suggesting the people of the far East in general and of
Syria in particular: cf. Euphrates in 1, 104.

63. chordas obliquas: i.e. sambucas, oriental harps; cf. Pers. 5, 95.

64. nec non: see note on 1. 204. gentilia: ‘ national.' The tam·
bourine was much used in oriental music, and particularly in the wild
rites of Cybele ; cf. 6, 515 and see note on 8, 176?

65. prostare: Poet. Lat. Min. ly, 370, 7 doctas circi prostare puellas,-
see note on Ι, 47.

67. trechedipna : from τρεχέδειπνος (i.e. τρέχων πρὸς δεῖπνον), applied toa
parasite by Plutarch (Quaest. Com). vm, ὁ, 1) : possibly in this instance,
the only occurrence of the word in Latin, ὑποδήματα is to be understood.
It seems to mean light shoes of elegant pattern, such as the parasites of
the Greek New Comedy wore. On Greek words, see ξ 46, α.

68. ceromatico: adjective from ceroma (κήρωμα), which signifies a wax
salve used by Greek wrestlers: cf. 6, 246. niceteria: prizes (νικητήρια)
won in gymnastic contests and worn suspended from the neck. The
complaint of Umbricius is that eve1-ything Greek is the fashion.¹

² E. Klebs (in Fricdl. p. 604) rendere qencz'lia by ‘auslandisch ⁸ (foreign), but gentilis
in this sense seems not to be attested before the third century. See F. Haverfield‚ Class.

⁸ W. v. Christ (Sitzungsb. bayr. Akad„ 1897, 1, p. 140), though hesitating to identiry
these Greek decoratione with the tesserae gladiatoriae, yet regards them as closely
connected, the latter probably modelled after the former.
