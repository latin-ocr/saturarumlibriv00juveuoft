lxvi INTRODUCTION

which is oftener a proper name. Ennius follows in his foot-
steps, and the same is true for Lucretius, except that the
number has been very much reduced. The versus spondiacus,
however, was a special affectation of the school of Catullus,
and they finally fixed the law that it must end in a proper
name of four syllables, Le. a dispondee. Momover, with a few
notable exceptions, such as Appenninus, the name must be
Greek. This law rcmained for the rest of the literature, but,
after Catullus, the line itself lingered chiefly in Vergil and
Ovid. It is not found in the satires of Horace, and in the
first-century epicis very rare. Persius in 1, 92 ridicules it
as an affectation.

The one notable exception is Juvena1.¹ He has more
than thirty cases, a larger proportion than is found in any
poet after Catullus himself. Moreover, he not only does not
bind himself to the Catullian law of the final word, but also
disregards ιῖιε· tendency of the earlier Homeric type as ex-
hibited in Ennius and Lucretius. In all of this he stands
alone, and both the frequency and the freedom of this line
seem to indicate a purpose in its use. Juvenal appears to
have felt that the versus spondiacus, in spite of its affecta-
tion by those later poets whom he despised, really belonged
to high epic. The one purpose which a majority of his ex-
amples have in common is emphasis. His mood may be
serious, sardonic, mock-heroic, or what not, and the purpose
of the emphasis will vary accordingly, but the residuum is
emphasis. Moreover, the freedom of cadence refiects the
variation of mood and seems to have been suggested by it.
