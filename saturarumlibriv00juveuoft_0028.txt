xxiv INTRODUCTION

was in the early period an essential feature of the satura and
was accepted as such by Horace, Juvenal also 1·ccognized,¹
and in this respect he conformed to the practice of his prede-
ccssors. ln his case, however, thc general effect is so modi-
fied by the constant presence of the spirit of censure, espe-
cially in the earlier books, which alone can be said to contain
real satires. that we are not so much impressed by the variety
of subject as by the uniformity of treatment. The element of
dialogum also. which was quite regular in the early stages
and was largely introduced by Horace, takes a less prominent
place in Juvenal. The ninth satire is the only real dialogue‚
the third is a long monologue with the necessary introduc-
tion and conclusion, and fragments of dialogue are found in
the first.² Thus we see that while dealing independently
with the satura, and developing it to some extent along lines
peculial· to himself, he was yet not entirely unmindful of the
example of his predecessors in this field. .
26. Reminiscences of other poets. Like most other
poets of his time, Juvenal was doubtless a diligent student
of literature, both Greek and Roman. His use of Homeric
names and comparisons ³ and his occasional reminiscences of
Lucilius, Ovid, Petronius, Seneca,⁴ and other writers, which
are pointed out from time to time in the commentary,
furnish good ground for this statement. But there are
authors whose greater influence on the satirist calls for
special remark ; namely, Vergil,5 Horace,⁶ and Martial.⁷
When we remember that by the latter part of the first cen-
tury Vergil and Horace were the text-books of every Roman

poets everywhere in the literature of the period. In the
