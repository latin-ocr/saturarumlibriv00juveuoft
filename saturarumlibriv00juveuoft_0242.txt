SATIRE IV
THE nmmum. couxcn,

It is diffieult to believe that the parts of which this satire is com-
posed were originally intended by the author to form one harinonious
whole ; for harlnonious in any strict sense they certainly are not. The
first part (11. 1-27), which looks like 11 portion of a satirelevelled at the
upstart Egyptian, and the last part (11. 37-15-1), which describes the 3558111-
bly and proceedings ot* the imperial council, are joined in the loosest
fashion by lines 28-36.8 But. whatever may have been the original in-
tention, we are not justified in assuming that any other hand than that
of the author arranged the satire 35 it stands. For similar lack of har-
mony in structure, see Satires 1, 7, and 11.

Whether Domitian reall)⁷ (lid summon his advisers to plan sor the dis-
posal of a 11511 may be doubted, notwithstanding ‹Juvenal’s assertion (l.
35 res vera aqilur), though it is not- inherently improbable. lt seems
more likely that the present satire is a burlesque account of some meet-
ing held at Domitian's Alban villa, 511811 as that which took place before
the war with the Chatti, 83 A.D. (cf. l. 147)‚⁴ a meeting described, of
course in serious vein, by Statius in his De Bello Germanico, os which
the scholiast (Valla) on l. 94 quotes the following verses :

lumina Nestorei mitis prudentia Crispi

et Fabius Veiento—potentem signat utrumque
purpura, ter memores implerunt nomine fastos—
et prope Caesareae confinis Acilius aulae.⁵

¹ Auditor. which was probably the reading of P, though given up by Bacch. (1893),
has since been defended by Polstorff (1896) and Duff (1898), and is now read by Owen
(1902). It is certainly not lectio difficilior, but makes far better sense than adiutor (ῃω);
for. as Polstorff remarks, mm adiutorem optant poetae, sed auditorem.

'² There is 11818 110 reference m the soldicr's boot (note on l. 248), for caliqae were worn
also by country-men and even by women: cf. Edict. Diocles. lx, 53, 6, 10 with Blflm-
ner's note (p. 120) and 588 W. v. Christ, l. l. p. 142.

³ For a different view. see A. Gercke, Gott. gel. Anz.. 1896, pp. 981 ff.

⁴ On July 22d. 8-2 Α.1)., Domitian held a meeting adhibitis utriusque ordinis splendidis
siris ‹c.1.L. ix. 5420).

⁶ Fabricius Veiento (note on l. 113> is called Fabius, doubtiess to mark him as a man of
cantion and sorethought like Fabius Cunctator, the great opponent of Hannibal. See

F. Buecheler. Rhein. Mus.. xxxtx, 1884, pp. 283 f. and S. Gsell‚ Εεεαὶ sur le reque de
l'empereur Domitien, 1893, p. 61, note 6.
