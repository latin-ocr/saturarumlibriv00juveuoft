INTRODUCTION xi

Dum tu forsitan inquietus erras
Clamosa, Iuvenalis, in Subura,
Aut collem dominae teris Dianae;
Dum per limina te potentiorum
Sudatrix toga ventilat vagumque
Maior Caelius et minor fatigant:
Me multos repetita post Decembres
Accepit inea rusticumque fecit

Here there is no hint that Juvenal has devoted himself to
literary pursuits, nothing but the contrast between the quiet
restfulness of the Spanish town and the wearisome duties of
the client 111 the capital.

9. The satires as a biographical source. When we look
into the satires for information with regard to the life of
their author, we should use discretion, for a poet is not
necessarily his own biographer. Many a picture which he
presents may be purely literary, due to the influence of
department or of other writers, and may have no existence
in fact. Even what seems to have a direct person-al reference
should not in all cases be regarded as authoritative. We may
reasonably expect, however, to draw from the satires some
inferences with regard to the poet's education and char-
acter² and to fix approximately the period of his literary
activity.

10. Dates of publication. Juve'nal, like many other an-
cient writers, published his satires in books at different times,
and apparently in the order in which they now stand 111 the
Mss. In the first book (Sui. 1—5) the latest indication of time
is the reference to the condemnation of Marius Priscus, which
took place in the year Νι).3 llcucc these satircs as a whole
must have been publishcd after that date, in all probability
several years after, unless we arc to separate the publication of
the first book from that of the second by an unnaturally long
