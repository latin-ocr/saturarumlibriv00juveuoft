SATIRE XVI
'mn ADVANTAGES or mmmm( mre

Countless advantages belong to the soldier who is attended by good
fortune (ll. 1-6). If a civilian is assaulted by a soldier, he dare not
prosecute before the centuri0n3 for all the soldiers are hostile and
civilian witnesses are afraid to appear (ll. 7—34). Instead of the tedicus
delays of civil courts, the soldier can have an immediate settlement of
1115 disputes (ll. 35-50)‚ and he is the only man who cau control his pos-
sessions while his father lives (ll. 51-60).

The genuineness of this fragment has often been denied from the
times of the scholiast to our own. But it is quoted as genuine by Servius
and Priscian, and in both style and content is not unworthy of Juvenal.

1. praemia: the technical term for the rewards of a soldier honorably
discharged ; cf. Res Gest. Div. Any. 3, 31 militabas, qu)6s emer-itm
stipendis ιή sua municipi& remisfl, praemwa mamerato persolv-Q· Suet.
A aq. 17 praemia et missionem poscentium. Here, however, as in 1. 35,

11 15 practically the same as commoda (l. 7). Galli: the persons
addresscdin Sat. 11-16 are unknown.
2. nam: the emphasis onfelicc's makes the connection clear. eastra:

the soldiers of the praetorian guard, which was quartered just outside
the city walls (note 011 10, 95), received twice the pay of the legionarias
and were discharged after sixteen years of service ; cf. ll. 25ff 3 Tac.
Αηη. 1, 17, 9.

¹ The reasons why Pythagoream abstained from meat are given by Plut. περὶ
σαρκοφαγίας, pp. 997 E and 998 c; cf. Porphyr. De Aba-lin. 11, 28: 111, 1 (see Nauck's
index, p. 221).
