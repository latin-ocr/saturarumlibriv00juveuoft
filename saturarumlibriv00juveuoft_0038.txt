xxxiv INTRODUcnoN

the compound. This may sometimes be due to the preser-
vation of the simple verb in this sense from an early period
orto fondness for alliteration, but as a rule it marks the
influence of poetic diction or of the language of daily life.
Examples are 3, 137 testem dare (= ede7·e); 11, 50 cedere foro
(z excedere) 3 1, 141 ponit apros (z apponit) 3 14, 94 tojam
hane turbavit (z conturbavit) ; 7, 47 posita est (z disposita).¹

45. Desiderative verb for simple. The fact that desid-
erative verbs (in acrio) occur for the most part in Comedy,
Satire, Petronius, Martial, and Apuleius, shows clearly their
vulgar and colloquial origin. In the Silver Age they are
sometimes used without desiderative force: ey. 6, 309 mic-
turiunt (= minyunt) 3 Petron. 64 canturire ( z cantare);
Schol. on Pers. 1, 112 ne in loco sacro micturiant (z min-
yant). Elsewhere in Juvenal desiderative verbs have their
natural meaning : 3, 783 7, 7, 87; 13, 99; 14, 127 esurire;
16, 46 onietari7·e.²

46. Borrowed words. These, as a rule, came into the
literature through the language of daily life ; a few, doubt-
less, through literary channels.

a. Greek. Several hundred Greek words are found in the
satires, especially in passages where the spirit of invective or

- ridicule is most prominent. Many of these occur only in

Juvenal: eq. 8, 128 acereecomes; 6, 477 cosmetae; 7, 120
epimenia ,⁰ 3, 68 niceteria ,⁴ 7, 46 anabathra. Some words
the satirist seems himself to have coined: eff. 3, 68 cero-
maticus (κήρωμα) ; 7, 119 petasunculus (πετασών) ; 2, 65 stoi-
ciclae (στωικὰς).3

ὂ. Gallio (Celtic). Juvenal uses several words of Gallio
origin which were probably common in the sermo cotidianus:
ey. 8, 147 and 9, 132 carpentam; 3, 10, 236 and 4, 118
Juvenal. in Trans. Am. Phil. Asson, xxxr, 1900, pp. 202-22.
