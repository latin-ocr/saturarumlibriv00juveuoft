120 COMMENTARY

SATIRE XII

A MARVELLOUS ESCAPE

In this satire Juvenal must be found guilty on charges of weakness,
ainbiguity, and obscurity‚ especially iu the description of the storin (ll.
18-82). Some have objected to his inconsistency in bringing together
subjeots so dissimilar as thanksgiving for a friend’s escape from ship-
wreck (ll. 1-92) and a bitter attack ou legacy-hunters (ll. 93-130)‚ and
the objection is not without force. Still, these subjects are not entirely
unconneeted. The satirist expresses genuine joy at the safe return of
Catullus and then defends himself from the imputation of sinister
motives. KVhen once captatio is mentioned, his tendency to digress
carries him into the subject ; see ξ 141 and notes on ll. 82 and 104.
