SATIRE VII

THE DISCOURAGEMENTS OF LITERARY ΜΕΝ

Judged by common litei-ary standards, this satire is lacking in har-
monicus structure and due proportion, but these faults are not unusual
in Juvenal (ξ 36). Friedl. argues that the body of the poem (ll. 36-243)‚
which deals with the inadequate return for intellectual effert—five dif-
ferent professions are taken as types—was coniposed in the reign of
Trajan, but that the introduction (ll. 1-21)‚ which points to better pros-
pects for poets through the emperor's favor, was written after the acces-
sion ot' Hadrian (117 Ab), and badly joined to the earlier piece by ll.
22-35. Granting, as we must, that the Caesar of lines 1-‘21 is Hadrian,
who favored the pursuit ot* literature (ἓ 10), we are not on that account
obliged to assume an earlier date. for the composition ot' the rest. It
seems more likely that early in Hadrian’s reign Juvenal wrote this satire,
expressing his hope based on the imperial favor, but describing condi-
tions as they were and had been.²

1-35. No longer need pocts give up literary pursuits, and eke out a
livelihood in baser occupations; an indulgent emperor is ready to be
their patron. Let them not expect support from any other source 3 for
the rich bestow nothing hut praise, leaving the poet to meet old age in
poverty and discouragement.
