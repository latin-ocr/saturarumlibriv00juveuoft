SATIRE XV
anMAmTY or Tun EGYPTIANS

This satire is little more than an invective aimed at the despised Egyp-
tians, for whom Juvenal has already expressed his utter contempt (g 19).
An instance of cannibalism‚ arising out of a religious feud, is reported
as a recent occurrence and described in minute detail, though, for
reasons suggested in the note on l. 33, it seems possible that the whole
story is a mere invention. Nor is it necessary to conclude from l. 45
that the author had ever been in Egypt ε he had certainly never visited
the region in which this scene is laid (g15). Like others of the later
satires the fifteenth is marred by absurd exaggeration and tedicus
repetitiom the strongest passage is that which treats of sympathy as the
noblest attribute of man (ll. 131 ff.).

For the date of composition, see ἐ 10 and note on l. 27.

1. Volusi: the persons addressed in Sat. 11-16 are unknown. The
opening verses reflect the thought and to some extent the language of
Cic. Taso. V, 78 Aeyyptiorum morem quis ifflwrat 9 etc.
