80 COMMENTARY

petere, quinque aureos, nam non licebat amplius dare, but this leaves the
force of vietor unexplaincd.

SATIRE VIII
THE VANITY or NOBLE Briz'rn

The eighth satire, though marked by fine passages, cannot be called
one of Juvenal's best efforts. The thesis that noble birth is wortffless,
unless adorned by noble character, is worked out from various points of
view with a wealth of illustration and excess of rhetorical commonpsace.
” In a series of examples, drawn chiefly from Roman history, the writer
sets the vices and crimes of aristocrats over against the virtues and
great aehievements of plcbeians, This picture, of course, like many of
Juvenal's pictures, is one-sided ; the satirist selected material to suit his
purpose. Both parallel and contrast are surnished by the fourth satire
of Persius, which is worked out from the Stoic point of view.

Here again Juvenal's characteristic lack of sense for proportion is
evident (ἓ 36). From an exhortation to a provincial governor to show his
real nobility by a just and honest administration, the author is led into a
long digression (ll. 94-126) on provincial misgovernment, which certainly
has no direct connection with the main thesis (ἓ 141). Α really good ap-
preciation of the public services of Cicero, Marius, and others concludes
the satire.
