SATIRE X

THE VAxITY OF HUMAN WISHES

The world's literature contains numerous discourses on this subject,
none of which is so well known or has exerted so wide an influence
as that of Juvena1.¹ English literature especially offers many remi-
niscent-es, translations, and imitations; the most famous is Dr. John-
son's ‘ Vanity of Human wishes) '

In common 111111 0111015 of the later satires, the tenth has certain
marked features which distinguish it from Juvenal’s earlier work : it
shows little contact with the life of the times, but has rather the char-
acter of a rhetorical treatise or essay (see p. XV, note 2). The author
selects his illustrations from the common stock of the schools of decla-
mation (note on 1, 16), and, as one might expect, brings out only those
features which 50110 1115 purpose. Yet, notwithstanding the excessively
florid style and, 111 501110 parts, tedious rhetoric, the tenth satire, be-
cause of the vigor ot' its narrative, the brilliance of its description, the
exuberance ot its illustration, and the real applicability of its teaching
to our own and every time, will continue to be a favorite with readers
of Juvenal.
