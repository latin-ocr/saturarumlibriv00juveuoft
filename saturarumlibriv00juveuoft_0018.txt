xix· Α INTRODUCTION

the praenomen is given as Marcus, which should perhaps be
explained as a reminiscence of the well-known name M.
Iunius Brutus.¹ With regard to the date of Juvenal's birth
there hasbeen wide divergenee of opinion.² If we accept
the statement of the ancient biographies that he practised
declamation until middle life,³ then, by a backward calcu-
lation from the time when the satires began to be published,
we may arrive approximately at the date sought. If the
first book was published about the year 105, and Juvenal
was then in middle life, he must have been born not long
before the year 60. There seems no reason to doubt that
his birthplace was Aquinum in Latium, the town near
which the inscribed. tablet⁴ set up by Iunius Iuvenalis was
found and with which the poet's allusion in the third satire
shows intimate acquaintance.⁵

13. Early life. With regard to Juvenal’s social position,
the only direct evidence is the statement of the ancient
biographies that he was the son, or adopted son, of a rich
freedman.⁶ Whether this be true οι· not, he seems to have

Lat. xm) we read at the end of the second book : Decimici iunii iuvenalis satirarum
liber ii emptio-it. The praenomen Decimus is attested also by the scholiast of P in a note
on the rita which is given in ἓθ.

¹ This is suggested by Dfirr, l. l. p. 9.

Ἰ Teuffel in Pauly's Reat-Encwt„ 1v, p. 537. gave 42 as the date z on the other hand,
Friedlander, De Iuvenalis ritae temporibus, Kenigsberg 1875. argued for 67. and almost
every date between has found its advocate. In his edition, however, Friedl. (p. 15)
assigns the poet's birth to a time not long before and not long after the year 60. A vila
published by Dfirr (l. l. p. 28) from the end of a Me. (saec. xv) in the Palazzo Barberini
at Rome, besides giving the names of the poet's mother, sister, and tenebere, as well as
other details, assigns a definite date for his birth, Claudio Nerone et L. Antistio ‹mz-
salibus, i.e. 55 ΛΦ. But this biography bears on its face the marks of its late orig1n‚ and
probably rests ou no more secure foundation than the fertile lmagination of some scholar
of the fifteenth century.

³ This statement is supported by ι, 25, evidently written by a man no longer young.

⁴ The inscription referred to is given in ς 7.

⁶ 3, 319, where Umbricius, addressing Juvenal, says tuo Aquino. All the vitae, ex·
cept the best one, call the poet Aquinas. but this is probably no more than an inference
from the passage just cited.

⁶ See ς 6. But this statement is rejected by F. 1. Merchant. Am. Jour. Phil„ xxn,
1901. pp. 57 f.. on the ground that Juvenal's openly expressed hatred for freedmen as a
class precludes the possibility that he was himself a freedman's son.
