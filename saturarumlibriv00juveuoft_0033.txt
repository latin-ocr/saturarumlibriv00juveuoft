together with the Bodleian additions mentioned in the fol-
lowing section, may be supposed to have come from an
earlier archetype.¹

33. Codex Bodleianus. One. of the MSS. of thc inferior
class desei-ves more extended notice, because of certain fea-
tures which make it unique among the sources of the text of
Juvenal: 1 refer to the Bodleian MS. (Canonicianus xm) of
the eleventh century, brought to light by E. Ο. Winstedt, who
published the first collation in May, 1899.2 Th-is codex,
though decidedly one of the «ιο-011133, oftener, perhaps, than any
other of its fellows is in agreement with P, and at the same
time offers some readings which are quite new and well worth
001131ᾶο1011011.3 Its most important features, however, are
that it is written in a Lombardie hand, though Ppr arc
in Caroline minuscules, and that it makes two additions to
the traditional text of Juvenal, 0110 of two verses, the other
of thirty-four verses, both in the body of the sixth satire.⁴
If the verses are Juvenal's—and no one but Buecheler has
expressed a doubt of their genuineness—it seems probable
that the parent of the Bodleianus, which itselt came from a
common archetype with ω, received the additions from some
MS. not only earlier than P, but earlier than the recension of
Nicacus.⁶

¹ Buecheler (l. l.), however, believes that all the extant Mss. are derived from the
Nicaean recension, and tries to account for the fact that P has not preserved the sub-
scription of Nicaens. ”

268-82, and literature there cited. No trace of the newly discovered verses is yet reported
from any other Ms. ; Max Mass (A.L.L. XI, 1899, p. 420) examined sixteen in Munich,
and E. O. Winstedt more recently fifty-nine iu thc British Museum for this purpose
(class. Rem, ΧΠ, 1902, pp. 40-6).

⁶ P. ν. Winterfeld, in Gblt. gel. Anz„ 1899, p. 896, has shown how this may have taken
place. The scribe of the archetype os the Bodleiamm placed the shorter addition of two
verses on the margin ς but, not having room ser thelonger passage, inserted a leaf to con-
tain it, making the necessary indications to show its place in the text (after v 345). But
the copyist ot the Bodleianus, not observing the sign, finished the page (to V. 365) and
then added the thirty-four verses from the inserted leat. This would account sor the
position of the verses in the ΜΞ.
