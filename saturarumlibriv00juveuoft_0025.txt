of. the satirist. Much more may this be said of Rome, with
its great wealth, its large proletariat which had to be fed and
amused at public eost, and its hordes of slaves who were
sapping the very foundations of the empire by corrupting
the home, the fountain of national strength. Nevertheless it
seems likely that Juvenal, at least in those satires which are
not purely general, had before his eye for the most part only
the past, sometimes the distant past known to him only
from history, but as a rule the reign of Domitian, during
which his own early manhood was passed. His peculial· con-
fusion of past and present might· bc illustrated by many
examples. In Salim 13, 157, which was published later than
127st he mentions Rutilius Gallicus, the praefectus urbi, as
if still living and discharging the duties of his office. But
Gallicus died in 91 01· 92, having been praefectus urbi some
four or five years earlier.² Crispinus, the favorite of Domi-

them long since dead, move before us as contemporaries of
the poet; and, to go farther back, Sophonius Tigellinus,⁰
the wanton and cruel favorite of Nero, is chosen as a type of
the influential man whom it would be dangerous to attack.

nal would produce an entirely false and one-sides] impression
of the Rome of the first century if we should fail to observe
that almost without exception his satire is directed against
the wealthy, the powersul, and the higher classes of society.
Especially in the first three books are they assailed under
various names,⁷ and accused of every conceivable form of
crimes* The women of noble birth come in for their
share of condemnation in the sixth satire, in which there
passes before our eyes a series of vivid pietures hardly to be
paralleled in literature for lurid eoloring and disgusting
