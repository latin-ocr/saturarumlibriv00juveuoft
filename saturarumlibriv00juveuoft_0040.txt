a. Collectively: ey. 3, 285 aenea lampas; 7, 46 conducto
tiyz'llo,· 7, 132 lonyo assere.

b. With an adjective that implies plurality ε eff. 1, 120 f.
densissima lectio-cn· 8, ’ἵ malta virya ; 8, 58 plurima palma. ⁹

50. The use of one 01· more proper names in singular or
plural to designate a class is common in Juvenal: eq. 1,
108 f. eqo possideo pl us Pallante et Licin z's; 2, 40 tertias e caelo
cecidit δαῖος 12, 39 teneris Maeeenatz'bas.¹

51. Juvenal is very fond of using personal names from
mythology as appellatives : ey. 1, 61 Automedon (= driver) 3
4, 65 Atrides (z emperor) ; 16, 26 Pylades (z friend).²

52. Instead of a substantive with an attributive adjective
or a genitive of quality, the substantive is sometimes in the
genitive dependent on another substantive, which really con-
veys in a more emphatic way the-meaning of the adjective or
genitive of quality: eq. 1, 10 aarum pelliculae (= auream-
pelliculanz); 4, 39 spatium admirabile rhombi (= rhombus
spatii admirabilis) 3 10, 75 f. secura senectus principis,

53. For certain forms of filias which are unsuitable to the
metre, the corresponding forms of iuvenis are used: ey.
3, 158 iuvenesque lanistae ; 4, 95 3 8, 2623 10, 310 ; 14, 23.

The Adjective

54. As substantive. The substantive use of the adjec-
tive is very free in Juvenal, and in many cases a second ad-
jective is added to modify the first : eq. 1, 149 in praecipiti
vitium stan,- 10, 107 inpulsae praeceps inmane ruinae‚· 1,
71 reales propinqaas; 6, 548 divitis 01·sz ,· 14, 178 prope-
rantis αυανί.3

55. As adverb. Adjectives, especially those which desig-
nato time. are often used where the sense would require an
adverb οι· an adverbial phrase ε ey. 1, 28 ventilet aestivum
