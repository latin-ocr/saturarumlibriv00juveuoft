8, 169 f. maturus. . ‚tuendis amnibus ,· 12, 7 templis maturus
et arae.¹

84. The dative os the agent (so called) is used not only
with the gerundivo but also with the perfect participle : ey.
6, 559 civis formidatus Othoni ,· 15, 98 dicta milei qens ,· and
with the present indicative passive : 6, 45 f. illi quaeritur.

85. Genitive. The genitive of quality is sometimes used
instead of a second adjective: ay. 3, 48 mancus et euinc-
tae.. dextram 12, 30 ff. (of a ship) plenus et. . .arboris in-
certae ,· 9, 29, 31 3 cf. Seneca, Med. 21. In 11, 96 the ablative
of quality is similarly used.

86. The partitive genitive in the singular or plural is occa-
sionally dependent on an adjective in the neuter plural ε 12,
55 discriminis ultima ,· 15, 95 bellorumque ultima ; cf. Lucr.
1, 1102 ultima naturai; Luc. VIII, 665 ultima mortis. This
is rare in early Latin, but becomes common from the time of
Livy, and is especially frequent in Tacitus.²

87. The genitive is used with felix to denote the seat of
the feeling: 14, 119 animi felices. Such genitives (usually
animi) may originally have been locatives.³

88. The genitive is found with the following present parti-
ciples and verbal adjectives : amans 3, 228 3patz'ens 1, 31 ; 7,
33; inpatiens 6, 238, 3273 7, 573 metuens 5, 1543 7, 210;
tenax 8, ‘253 capax 11, 41 ; 12, 443 15, 144st

89. Refert is used with the genitive of the person in 16, 58
ducis hoc referre videtur. This construction, rare in the
Classical period, seems to appear first in Sall. qu. 111, 1
illorum. . ,retulisse Interest, which is regular with the
genitive, is, of course, unsuitable to the dactylic hexameter?

90. Eyere is followed by the genitive in 14, 288 curatoris
eyet ; 15, 147 cuius eyent, though the ablative, which is regu-
