xliv INTRODL'CTION

79. Necdum occurs iu the sense of simple nondum: 1, 6
scriptus el in tergm necdum finitus Orestes. Clear cases of
this change occur in Livy and Tacitus and later become very
numerous. sec z ozon, however, is found in early Latin,
ey. Plaut. Most. ‘240 rnec φθεὶρ]

80. Instead of the correlative use of nec we find nec...
aul (8, 217 f.; 14, 173 ᾗ), nec. . succ. .. (13, 43 ᾗ), and
nec...-que. . ,aut (15, 124 fi). Such irregularities are not
rare in poetry.²

 

The cases

81. Accusative. The accusative of the inner object is
common in Juvenal: ey. 1, 16 f. w} altum dormiret‘; 2, 3
Bacchanalia vivunt ; 14, 295 aestivum tonat?

82. Aaderc is found with the accusative nine times in
Juvenal; 2, 2 aliquid dc moribus auclcnt; 10, 17¹4 f. quidquid
Graecia mendax audet in historia; 2, 82 ; 6, 97 3 8, 165; 15,
122. It is doubtful whether the Romans felt the omission
of an infinitive in such cases.‘

83. Dative. a. After similis and dissimilis Juvenal em-
ploys the dative, except 10, 192 dissimilemque sui: (3.9. 2, 333
3, 183 5, 1323 6, 7, 165; 15, 68. The genitive was the con-
struction in early Latin and was more common for persons
even in the classical period.

b. Certain adjectives which are usually followed by prepa
ositional phrases are found in Juvenal only with the dative,
often of the gerundive construction: cy. (1) aptus: 7, 58 f.
aptusque bibendis fontibus; 6, 5813 15, 1453 (2) utilis:
14, 71 f. utilis acris, utilis.. spebus aqendis; 10, 3483 but
oftener of persons, ey. 6, 210, 2403 7, 963 9, 273 (3) diver-
sus .· 10, 3 vera bona atque illis multum diversa ; (4) maturus.-
