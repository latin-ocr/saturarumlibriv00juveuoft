INTRODL'CTION lx

notasset, ac statim per honorem militiae quamquam octogenarius urbe
summotus est missusque ad praefecturam cohortis in extrema parte
tendentis Aegypti. id supplicii genus placuit. ut levi atque ioculari
delicto par esset. verum intra brevissimum teinpus angore et taedio
periit.

This ve'ta,¹ added by a later hand at the end of the codex
Pithoeanus, and found also in a considerable number of other
MSS„ was probably eompiled in the fourth or fifth century by
the commentator known as the Probus of Valla.² Most of its
statements seem to have no better foundation than untrust-
worthy tradition and unwarranted inference from passages
in the sati1·es.³ The first sentence, however, contains details
which could not easily be inferred from the poet’s works,⁴
and, judged from the point of view of expression, may well
be derived from some authority much nearer the time of
Juvenal.

7. The inscription of Aquiniun. From the neighbor-
hood of Aquinum comes an inse1·ipti0n,⁵ existing now only
in copy, dedicated to Ceres by one Juvenal who is generally
believed to be identical with the author of the satires.' It
reads as follows :

CereRI · SACRVM
d . z'ecNIVS · IVVENALIS
trib. COH · ι’ · DELMATARVM
Il ·V1R · QVINQ · FLAMEN
DIVI · VESPASIANI

VOVIT · DEDICAYiquE
SVA PEC,
¹ Dfirr's 1 12 = Jahn·s 1. ² For a brief account 01· this Probus, see 5 34.

³ The reference to Egypt is probably due to inference from 1110 fifteenth satire (note
ou 15, 45) ; cf. the expression semenstribus militiolis tumentem with 7. 88 f.

⁴ But see F. Ι. Merchant, Am. «Jour. 1'hil., xxn. 1901, pp. 51 ff„ who tries to show
that even these details might have been deduced from the satiree.

⁰ This identification is denied by Η. J. de Dompierre de Chnufepie. De titulo [RN.
