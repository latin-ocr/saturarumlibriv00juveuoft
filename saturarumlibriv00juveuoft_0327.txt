SATIRE XIII 127

every day (ll. 120-173). Revenge is sweet, perhaps, but is contrary to
the highest wisdom. The erimina-l will live a lise of terror aud mental
torment, and will finally pay the penalty of his crimes (ll. 174—249).‘'

Though characterized by monotonous commonplaee and tedious repe-
tition, this satire contains passages which bear coxnparison with any-
thing Juvenal has written. Cf. eg. ll. 91 ff. and 217 ff.

1. committitur: so l. 104 ; admittere, found in l. 237 ; 6, 494 ; 10, 255,
340, is the usual word iu this connection.

2. displicet: Sen. Ep. 42, 2 neo ulla maior poena nequitiae est quam
quod sibi ac sais displicet. prima est haec ultio: the sting of re-
morse is a common subject, eg. Sen. Dtal. v, 26, 2 marimo. est enim
factae iniuriae poena fecisse, nec quisquam gracias adficitur qnam qui
ad supplicium paenitentiae traditur.

4. vicerit: ‘has won the ease’; ef. 1, 50 ¹victrix and see ’,Ξ 114, α.
urna: probably the receptaele iu which were deposited the ballots of the
iudices at the close of the trial.¹

5. Calvine: the persons addressed in Sat. 11-16 are unknown.

6. fidei violatae: the nature of the crime is explained in ll. 71 ff.

8. iacturae: ‘loss,’ as in 1. 177; for the primary idea of throwing
overboard, which is still preserved in our technical terms ‘jettison,’
‘jetsam,’ ef. 3, 125 ; 12, 52. mergat: see note on 10, 57.

9. multis hic cognitus: 12, 26 coymta multis.

10. e medio. .a.cervo. hence not unusual. On tautology, see§1 139.

11. ponamus: i.e. deponamus; see ἓ 44. flagrantior: see ἕο 5,(’7

12. vulnere maior: on this use of the comparative see ἓ 57, e.

13. quamvis levium: on quamvis with adjectives, see ἓ 114, b.

14. spumantibus . . ,visceribus: Sen. Oed. 358 felle m‘yro tabidum sprc-
mat iecur ‚· Aesch. Assum. 1034 ζωπυρουμένας φρενός; see note on 1, 45.

16. depositum: Plin. ad Trai. 96, 7 Christians took oath nwefidemfal-
lerent, ne depositum appellati abnegarent. Such a breaeh of trust does
not seem to have been unusual. post terga. reliquit: Luc. 1, 369;
Stat. Th. v, 507 : Sil. XVI, 335.

17. Fonteio consule: as Fonteius Capito was consul in 67 A.D., the date
of this satire may be set soon after 127 ς see ἓ 10 and note on 15, 27.

18. in melius. . . proficit : an awkward phrase, formed on the analogy of
the common in melius mutar-27, which occurs first in Sallust.²

20. victrix fortunae: Sen. Ep. 71, 30 sapiens quidem. vincit virtute for·

¹ Others understand the receptacle from which the presiding magistrate drew the
names ot the iudices before the trial; Friedl.. following Serv. Aen. vr, 431, thinks of

the drawing of lots to decide in what order cases should be brought on.
