SATIRE IV 4 5

1-27. Crispinus is again the subject of my satire and must often he,
because of his unspeakable crimes. At present, however, 1 speak of
something less serious. Ile bought a. mullet at an outrageous price and
for his own use. For the same sum the upstart might have bought a

farm.

1. crispinus: see ἓ 19 and note on 1. 108. The former attack is not
preserved, for it can scarcely be the mere mention in 1, 26 f. See ἓ 11.¹

they showed Most valor, spoke not for them.'

were the badge os the sacred office ; ef. ovid, Fast. vi, 457 f. nullaque

10. terram subitura: the Vestal Cornelia was buried alive for unchas-
tity by Domitian in 91 ΑΛ). But Juvenal does not refer to this ; he seems
merely to bc retailing town gossip.² The participle indicates no more
than the natural consequence of the act if it were proved ; see ,ξ 118, d.

begun late in the year 85.³
