XXX INTRODL'CTION

34. Scholia Pithoeana. The oldest commentary on
Juvenal of which we have any knowledge seems to have been
written iu the latter part of the fourth century.¹ This was
probably the commentary quoted by'G. Valla, in his edition
of Juvenal publishcd at Venice in 1486, though the MS. used
by him is no longer extant. In this MS„ which cnded abruptly
at Sat. S, 198, the author of the commentary was called
ΡΓοῦιιε,2 and is now usually referred to as the Probus of Valla,
inasmuch as he is known only by the copious quotations in
Valla's edition. A comparison of these extracts with the
scholia preserved in P and also, without the text, in a MS. of
St. Gall (n. 870) shows that both come from the same good old
source, though less valuable additions have been made in the
latter. These annotations, now known as the Scholia Pithoe-
αηα, have transmitted much useful information, especially
in regard to persons and places mentioned in Juvenal, and
they are of the highest importance for the constitution of the
text, preserving, as they sometimes do, readings which ante-
date all of the extant Mss.⁹

35. Scholia of Cornutus. Far more voluminous and for
the most part of little value are the scholia traditionally
attributed to one Cornutus.⁴ This commentary, which is
found with little variation in thc inferior MSS. from the ninth
century onward, now and then offers a good explanation, but,
on the whole, abounds in absurdities, and in dealing with
Roman life, literature, and antiquities often displays the
grossest ignorance.⁶

² This date depende on the schol. on ιο, 24, in which is mentioned Neratius Cerealis,
praefectus urbi in 352-3.

Β This Probus must, of course, not be confounded with M. Valerius Probus, the famous
grammarian of thc first century, whose career is sketched by sueton. De Gram. 24.

³ Cf. R. Beer, l. l. pp. 41 f.‚ and Chr. Stephan‚ De Pithoeam's in Iuvenalem scholiis,
Bonn, 1882. These scholia were edited by Jahn, 1851, and iu selectione by Buecheler,
1893.

⁴ Of course, not L. Annaeus Cornutus. the friend and teacher of Persius.

⁵ E. Lornmatzsch, l. l. p. 376. n. 1. points out where these scholia are edited. Add to
his references W. Hoehler‚ Fleckeisen's Jahrb„ Suppl. xxm, 1897, pp. 379-442.
