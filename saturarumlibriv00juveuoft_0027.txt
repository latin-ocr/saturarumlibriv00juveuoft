in literature Juvenal mentions Lucan,¹ Q11i11tilian,² and

Statius,⁸ but has no reference either to his friend Martial
or to the other famous writers of the period. But, apart
from such names as represent well-known persons, there are
many names, appeariug 111 Juvenal alone. or in both Juvenal
and Martial, which are unknown from other sources.⁴¹ For
example, Matho in 1, 32 is a lawyer, in 7, 129 a bankrupt,
in 11, 34 a mouthing orator3 iu these, however, as in many
other similar cases, there is nothing to show that the salue
individual is meant. On the whole, it seems likely that
those names which cannot be connected with persons known
to history are, at least in many instances, purely fictitious
and were taken at random to represent certain more or less
clearly defined types.⁵

25. ‹Juvenal’s treatment of the satura. In devoting
himself to the composition of satire Juvenal claims to be a
follower of Lucilius and of Horace⁶; bnt, while preserving
the tradition of the department in certain respects 1111-
broken, he developed some features of the satura in a way
entirely his own. He did not allow himself the variety
of metres employed by Ennius, Lucilius, Varro, and Petro-
nius; but, following the example of Horace, confined him-
self to the dactylie hexameter. And yet the hexameter of
Juvenal is a very different verse from that of Lucilius or
even of Horace. Instead of the rather rough and eareless
metre of the earlier satirists, with its frequent elisions
and metrical licenses, we find in Juvenal the more polished,
stately, and sonorous rhythm which was characteristic
of the epic poetry of his time and which was based on
imitation of Vergil. The medley of subjects treated, which

⁴ Friedliintlcr (ed. 1). 1001, arguing from the assumption thut a reeurriug name in

satiris( usually introduces reu] persons und gives them their true names. But this
assumption is not warranted by the evidence.
