spent his early life at Rome, where he received the regular
education of the schools.¹ That his rhetorical studies were
long-continued is stated by the vitae, and could easily be
inferred from the satires themselves, which abound in sen-
tentiae and stock illustrations, and, especially in the later
books, are more like moral essays or declamations than real
satires.' Among his teachers may have been Quintilian,²
whom he several times mentions with greatest reverence.
During this earlier part of his life he may have heard the
recitations of the poet Statius, to whom he gives the warm-

Juvenal, but of some unknown rhetorician (Der echte und der uneclzce Juvenal. Berlin,
