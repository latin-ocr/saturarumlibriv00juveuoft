SATIRE XI 1 1 1

duction (ll. 1-55) presents some reflections on extravagance, and espe-
cially on excessive indulgence in the pleasures of the table.

1. Atticus: typica] sor a rich man; see 550. T. Claudius Atticus
Herodes, usually called Herodes Atticm, consul under Trajan and
Hadrian, was suddenly enriched by finding a great treasure.¹

2. Rutilus: a poor man. maiore cachinnet cf. 3, 100.

8. pauper Apicius: ‘ a poor man acting Apicius ’ ; see note on 4, 23.

4. convictus: here concrete ; see note on 1, 145.

5. de Rutilo: sc. loquantum· see gl38, b and cf. l. 21 ; 13, 181.

6. galeae: cf. 7, 33 cassidis. fertur: cf. 6, 648 f. feruntur prae-
cipites, ‘ rush on iu their mad career.‘

7. non. . ,tribunat ‘not of course under compulsion of the tribune,
yet without any interposition on his part.' Roman citizens who wished
to enter a school of gladiators (note on 8, 199) must formally declare ’
their intention before a tribune of the people.

8. scripturus: see 5118, a. He will subscribe to the gladiator’s oath
by which the lanista becomes his absolute (cf. reyia) master. The form
in Petron. 117 is uri vinciri verberari ferroque necari et quidquid
aliud. . jussisset.

10. macelli: where the gourmand will appear ; cf. 5, 95 and 6, 40.

11. vivendi causa: cf. Auct. ad Herenn. w, 39 oportet esse (eat), ut
vivas, non vivere, ut edas ,· see note on 8, 84.

12. egregius: the comparative of eqreye'e occurs only here. A less
awkward expression would be ut quisque 771vz'8err2'mus, ita optime σεπαί.2

13. et cito casurus: cf. 1, 34 et cilo rapturus and see ἓ 118, c.
perlucente rm‘na: a bold metaphor to express impending bankruptcy3
cf. 3, 195 : 2, 78 : Seu. Herc. F. 1001 perlucet omnis reyia. Ruina is
concrete, as in 10, 107.

14. gustus: ‘dainties’ ; see note on 5, 95. The usual meaning in
Silver Latin is ‘flavor,' eg. Plin. N. H'. XIV, 12 austeriorem qustum
vini. elementa: Ovid, Ponl. ῐ, 10, ef. quod mare, qnod lellus, ad·
pone, quod educat aer‚· m'l ibi, qnod nobis esuriatur, erit.³

16. adtendas: on the conditional, see ξ108, a,· here, however, the
apodosis is suppressed. ementur : sce g 136, b.

17. haut difficile: as in 14, 136 hant dubius, the metre does not allow
non ,⁴ of the remaining six occurrences of haul, four are with adjectives
(6, 7: 8‚198: 13, 200: 16, 8). one with adverb (3, 164), and one with

¹ Philoet. Vit. δορὴ. ιι, ι, 3; Borghesi, OEuvres, v, p. 533.
