SATIRE 1 3

5. Telephus, king of Mysia, was wounded by the lance of Achilles and
cured by the rust of the sanie weapon.¹ This story, as wellas that of
Orestes. was a favorite subject for tragedy and was used by all the great
Greek trugic poets. At Rome Ennius and Accius wrote tragedies with
this title} summi: this Orestes is so long that on the lust. sheet it fills
the margin tgthe very top and, though it runs.over on the back, is still
unfinished. The sheets of papyrus of which the roll consisted were glued
together at the sides where a considerable margin was left for this pur-
pose.³ margine: elsewhere osten masculine.⁴ Orestes : see notes
on 8, 215 ff. and 14, 284. On the rhytlnn, see §1431 d.

6. necdum: for nondum, though really equal to et nondum (ἓ 79).

7. During the time of Juvenal the most diligently cultivated class of
poetry was the epic, satirized in the next five verses. This preference

was due in large measure to the influence of Vergil and to the traiuing -

of the sc11ools.⁵ nota. . .domus: proverbial like our “as well as Ι
know my own name ” (3143) ; Cic. Quint. Frat. Ι, Ι, 45 cum iam tibi
Asia sic, uta· uni cuique sua domus, nota esse debeat.⁶ magis:
nola mayz'sznolc‘or, which occurs in 9, 25. See §51 α. lucus
Martis: probably the one in Colchis of Pontus, in which the golden fleece
hung guarded by a dragon (hence 14, 114 serpens Ponticus); cf. val.
Fl. V, 228 f. vellera Martis in umbra...P72r1·zus liquerat. On the
rhythm, see g147, d.

8. Aeoliis . . ‚Vulcanh northeast of Sicily lie seven volcanic islands,
known in antiquity as insulae Aeoliae.. from Aeolus the keeper of the
wiuds, or insulae L‘z'pctraeae, froni Lipara, the largest of the group.⁷ The
forge of Vult-an was localized in the most southerly os these islands,
Hiera (Ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου, still known as Vulcano), which Juvenal refers to
again in 13, 45 as Liparaea tabe-rna and Vergil calls Volcani domus et
Volcania nomine tellus (Aen. v111, 422).

9. venti: represented in most epic poems, e.g. Verg. Aen. Ι, 50-156 ;
val. Fl. Ι, 574-607; Luc. V, 597-614; Stat. Th. 1, 346 ff.
