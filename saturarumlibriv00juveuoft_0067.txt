companied by a ‘ trithemimeral ' caesura, and the result is a
tripartite verse, thus :

III. Flaminiam ΙΙ puer Automedon Ρ ΙΙ nam lora tenebat.

But this type is much more common in Juvenal than in
Martia] and the epic. It is usual to lighten the second third,
as Juvenal himself often does, by a trochaic caesura, thus z

IV. Hic elegos ? ss impune Ι diem ΙΙ consumpserit ingens.

Verses containing only a ‘hephthemimeral' caesura are
exceedingly rare.¹ The most striking example in Juvenal is:

V. Victrix turba nec ardenti ΙΙ decoxit aeno,

The other cases noted by Eskuche are 1, 1:353 6, 3663 10,
131, 2293 11, 106(?) 3 14, 196, 256; 15, 1433 16, 34. In the
majority of them the natural caesura has been obscured by
elision; compare 10, 358. The rarity of these verses is
sufficiently explained by reading them aloud.

c. Caesam κατὰ τρίτον τροχαῖον. The ‘ trochaic ’ or ‘femi-
nine' caesura was always admired by the Greeks and in their
later poetry was practically the rule. But in the Roman
poets, by whom it was shunned for the same reasons that
the ‘penthemimeral’ was cultivated, it is the rarest of all ·
caesurae. The 13 examples quoted from Juvenal (2, 146;
4, 120; 6, 192, 4503 7, 523 8, 100, 267; 10, 278: 11, 13:32
14, 137, 242; 15, 64, 116) represent about the average percent-
age of use in all Latin poetry after Catullus.² All but one ’
(6, 450) conform to the general rule that the ‘trochaic’
caesura must be accompanied by a ‘ trithemimeral,' thus :

VI. In laevum Ι couversusll at illi dextra iacebat.

A ‘trochaio’ caesura alone is of the utmost rarity.
