INTRODL'CTION xvii

have been intrusted to a man of eighty, and the satires them-
selves indicate with sufficient clearness that during the latter
half of his life Juvenal was almost constantly in Rome. In
the reign of Domitian, however, he may have been banished
for the reason assigned ¹ or for sonic other cause unknown to
us, or his appointment to some distant post during the term
of his military service may have given risc to the story. On
the whole, it seems possible that the tradition of the exile
rests on good foundation, while thc statements of time, place,
and cause are merely deductions from various passages of the
satires.²

16. Death. The exact date of ‹Juvenal’s death cannot be
determined. We have seen that he was writing as late as the
year 128; if we may accept as well founded the tradition in
several of the vitae that he lived to bc eighty or more years
of age, his decease may be placed in the latter half of the
next decade (135-140).

17. Knowledge of philosophy. Though the poems os
Juvenal do not furnish much information with regard to
the life of their author, they do offer a substantial basis on
which to form an estimate of his mental equipment and of
some aspects of his character. In the first place, his philo-
sophical knowledge is of the most elementary kind. By
nature he was not much given to reflection, but was pre-
eminently an observer who regarded the passions and activi-
ties of men with the greatest inte1·est.³ Hence we are not
surprised to learn that he never studied the doctrines of the
philosophical schools,⁴ though, like most rhetor-iciam, he
shows a superficial acquaintance with their chief tenets
For Juvenal, however, philosophy was little more than the
