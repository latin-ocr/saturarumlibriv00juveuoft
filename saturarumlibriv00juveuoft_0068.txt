is rendered less exceptional by the fact that enthymema is a
Greek word.

d. Bucolic- diaeresis, especially with a spondee in the
fourth foot, is common to the point of monotony in Catullus
and Lucretius. Avoidance ot' it is noticeablc in Vergil, and
it was used less and less by the more careful among later
poets, owing to the fact that it made conflict in the fourth
soot all but impossible. Compare:

VIII. Martis et Aeoliis vicinum Ι rupibus antrum.

«Juvenal in 1, 5 and 7 shows the only way in which this
diaeresis could be combined with conflict in the fourth foot.
Tho frequency of this diaeresis, especially with the more ob-
J'ectionable spondee in the fourth foot‚ is a notable charac-
teristic of Juvenal’s verse. The succession of them in 10,
153 f. seems to have been for a special purpose.

148. Juvenal's use of caesura, speaking in general, may be
best appreciated by reading a long passage aloucl. It will be
seen that the variety and freedonl of satire have been adapted
with great skill to the purposes οἱ declamation.

141». Dactyls and spondeos. The Latin language was
naturally rich in spondeos. In the hexameter of epic and
clegy there was a long struggle to avoid them, which culmi-
nated in the light and grac-esu] verse of Ovid. The conver-
sational tone of satire admitted them more freely. But
even here the effect of chronology is visible. Juvenal's 4495
of dactyls in the first four fect is slightly lai-ger than that of
Vergil. Persius and Lucan belong in the same class.

150. Schemata) The possible conibinations of dactyls
and spondet-s in the hexameter (particularly, of course, in
th<- first four feet) were known as the schemata. All 111036716-
