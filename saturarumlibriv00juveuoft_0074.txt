The sphere again is Lueretius and satire. Lucretius, probably
after Ennius, negleets the rule of a proper name. On the
other hand, most of his examples occur in passages which
are not epie, but dogmatie. Here also Juvenal imitates the
freedom of Lucretius. Only 6 οἳ 1115 25 cases are proper
names.

One line ending in a word of six syllables (7, 218) is found
in Juvenal (but see the note). Manitius quotes three
others from Lucretius and four or five more only from the
later poets.

154. To begin a new sentence or clause at the fifth foot,
as in 2. 15,

Atque supercilio brevior coma. verius ergo,

was usually avoided by the best poets. It occurs in Juvenal
with some frequeney, generally for effect, as in 1, 149, etc.
155. Elision ¹ is the law ot the Latin language. If it was
desirable to avoid it, the sentence had to be so arranged as
to prevent coneurrenee of vowels. Frequency of elision and
freedom in its use was characteristic of the spoken language,
and of comedy and satire, the two literary departments most
nearly allied 10 11. Ennius allowed harsh elision, but the
inssuenee of Homer, and possibly of the Saturnian, made
his use of 01151011 very limited. Lucilius had a great many,
but far less than eomedy. Lucretius followed Lucilius,
Catullus followed Ennius. Vergil avoided harsh elisions,
but otherwise is notable for his freedom. Ovid largely re-
duced elision, and the process of diminution finally reached
the vanishing point in some of the later Latin poets.
Juvenal shows a freedom which may be generally defined
as duc 10 1115 department, less, than that of earlier satire, far
greater, than that of contemporary epic or epigram. Other-
wise, with one or two exceptions, the following figures of
Eskuehe represent about the usual relative proportions :
