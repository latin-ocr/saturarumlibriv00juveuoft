Ι11 the last two feet, as will be seen, Juvenal avoids elision„
This began with Catullus and was finally settled by Vergil.¹
He also agrees with all poets after the satires of Horace in
avoiding any elision in the first thesis.² On the other hand,
except in the last two feet, Juvenal shows the freedom of
satire in taking no special pains to avoid the elision of a long
vowel. Also his frequent elision (83 cases) after the 3d the-
sis is always harsh because it tends to obscuro the caesura.

Only about 100 verses, according to Eskuche, contain as
many as two elisions. Less than a score have three elisions
(cf. 2,34; 10, 1973 13, 89, 108; 14, 127 3 16, 35). One only
(11, 161) contains five.

156. Hiatus ³ is the occasional exception to the universal
rule of elision. The sphere of it in hexameter is largely
Ennius, Lucilius, and Vergil. It occurs most readily with a
long vowel and before the caesura or some other (lecided
pause. Juvenal follows the rules. His cases are 12, 36 3 3,
703 6, 274, 4683 10, 2813 12, 1103 14, 49 3 15, 126 3 1, 1513
2, 26 ; 5, 158 ; 8, '241 (but see note).

157. Prosody. Synacrcsis shows nothing unusual and
diaeresis does not occur. The one unusual case of syncope is
striylibus (3, 263). Systole occurs only in the usual alterc'us
(6, 431 ; 10, 210; 11, 169 ; 15, 39) and once, imas (6, 572).

Final i 111 ubi and ibi is always short, in ubique and ibidem,
always long ; in milei, tibi, sibi, long in the thesis, short 111
the arsis.

Final o, not dative and ablative, is short in the arsis, long
in the thesis. But only verba] and adverbial o is found long
